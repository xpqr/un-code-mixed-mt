I would like to insist to the Portuguese Presidency that we must play a greater role , that it is time to take over and to secure greater participation for the European Union in this process .
I believe there are circumstances when the question of principles and institutional regulations is obliterated .
the procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999 .
I understand this anxiety , this fear that the agenda may be too limited , and yet I feel , as I said to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on returning from Helsinki , that we can work on the basis of this Helsinki mandate .
we need , in short , to have and to sustain the highest possible common standards and to find ways of securing these .
it is , of course , the responsibility of policies , and therefore our responsibility , to guarantee the safety of sea transport .
I believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and I would like to condemn it here and now .
Mr President , a couple of years ago , the previous Commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures .
therefore , whilst I welcome the strict basic conditions , I would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simple as possible .
in other words , will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached ?
the virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable .
it would be very difficult for those who propose a &apos; yes &apos; vote in any such future treaty to win the support of the Irish people if we lose our right to have our nominee to the European Commission .
this is why we have always said that enlargement was possible only if the diversity and freedom of the peoples of Europe was clearly recognised , i.e. by adopting flexibility founded upon the respect of national sovereignty .
the Union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renewables is actively stepped up .
throughout this conference , ladies and gentlemen , it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important , but the quality of what they will be saying .
society is surrendering itself to the economy .
with regard to the first area - new forms of governance for Europe - you already know that the Commission has undertaken to produce a White Paper and not a full legislative text since , in the light of major issues which are changing the structure of the way we interact , the Commission is first of all preparing for a debate ; we will subsequently discuss the content with you ; this will give rise to a policy document , and finally , a legislative document .
there is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets , however .
please take account , in strategic terms , in the revision and in the allocation of reserves , of employment needs , because this , fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require .
the Presidency and the Council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere , even though this summit provided an important basis .
indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state .
it conflicts with established economic and legal principles retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product .
Mrs Berger , in your Amendment No 2 to Recital 6 , you mention legal security .
we are looking for solutions .
they should be able to establish themselves in new markets , but also to leave old markets .
this may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the Committee on Budgetary Control as regards this issue .
for Greece , for the neighbouring countries Italy and Austria , but also for Europe as a whole , the social and economic restoration of the Balkans , bringing political stability , is a vitally important matter .
we therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed .
but the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions .
the Council must realise that , if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations , the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further .
some say that all the costs should be borne by the manufacturers ; that this is only right and in the very best interests of the consumer .
for twenty years , the majority within Parliament has attempted to make European environmental policy greener .
as for fishing , there is nothing in your programme to tell us that the predatory exploitation of fishing grounds , which has gone as far as to wipe out entire species of fish , will certainly prove fruitful in the future .
this is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves . this has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament , and I have raised the issue time and time again .
I am pleased to see that the Commission shares our view .
however , it seems that the Commission does not share this view , although it is the Commission which is obliged to present the Council and Parliament with a report on the functioning of the common fisheries policy over the last decade before the end of 2001 , and it is on this basis that the Council will have to make the appropriate decisions with regard to its modification .
in addition , there are Community directives , but they are seldom applied , if at all , due to the insufficient number of national inspectors .
this mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations .
what would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region , or in a 5b region ?
the Commission has proposed creating a European fund for refugees to which Parliament was favourably disposed .
precise application of this principle can only reinforce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of competence .
we must understand that the bigger picture is important when it comes to the environmental impact of cars .
merit must be recognised and rewarded , specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade .
we must all ensure that it is not always the same person , i.e. the vehicle owner , who pays .
these are the three most important aims of the directive .
the economies are growing , we are enlarging to 25-30 Member States .
I regret that the manufacturers have harangued the European Parliament and the Council with a whole ream of arguments which either cut no ice or were simply false .
the German Social Democrats voted against the von Wogau report because , in their view , it might break up European policy on competition , which is to say , in plain terms , attacking the standardising superstate .
if there is a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC , then I say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this .
question No 38 by ( H-0805 / 99 ) :
this time limit , which indeed is identical to the one we granted for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 DOCUPs , should normally be adequate , I feel , for drawing up a programme , which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage .
we need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind .
I would ask the Council to adopt it swiftly and I would ask Parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bases of our social cohesion .
if we assume that , on average , a car has a life of eleven years , do Members , indeed does anyone , believe that we should wait for eleven years before we get to grips with this problem ?
the Commission ought - and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission , for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body OLAF .
finally , I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and , in particular , of course , the rapporteur , Mrs Berger .
the Tampere Summit was certainly an important milestone in 1999 for Europe , and for the area of freedom , security and justice in particular .
we must reduce CO2 emissions , employ renewable energies , and generally make enquiries , in this connection , as to how the forests of Europe are faring .
the Council ?
the suspension of the talks between Syria and Israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the Middle East .
the basic aim of the communication is twofold .
funding for NGO programmes in Tajikistan amounted to EUR 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999 .
Mr President , this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by Mr Middelhoek to investigate allegations of fraud , nepotism and corruption in the European Commission .
it is based on three strands. strand A organises cross-border cooperation between regional and local authorities in border regions , at both internal and external borders of the European Union , on the basis of joint cross-border development strategies which Member States &apos; local and regional authorities are responsible for implementing. strand B governs transnational cooperation between national , regional and local authorities in various Member States or applicant countries regarding regional development , transport networks and the environment .
the first comment , which has been made by many others too , is whether women should be mentioned separately .
we have now obtained a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measures .
Madam President , I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate .
the decision on this initiative was taken in Berlin , where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action .
it seems to me blindingly self-evident that some action is necessary .
I wish that the Chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the Dalai Lama .
in all these respects we must ensure real , significant change , including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards , including the mandatory double hull , on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of Member States .
it is intolerable that the EU should involve itself in the formation of the government in a Member State .
I think that this is also the case here , but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments .
the Commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings .
the general impression at present is that anything budget-related within Europe is bad .
I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement , also with its amendments .
I come from a region , Galicia , which has suffered similar accidents in the past .
in order to ensure that the Treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the Community machine , we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday .
following the attack in Hadera on Monday , we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism .
finally , on the content of the debate , I welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom , security and justice at the top of its agenda .
I would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid .
we accept the predominant role of the Council in this , but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail .
. ( it ) Mr President , as the rapporteur , Mrs McCarthy , has already pointed out , we can certainly consider URBAN a success for the European Parliament with regard to the debate held last year on the reform of the regulations .
the rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry , but today those areas might have become a burden , and they may well be poor , meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production , as I might call it , and the production of services , because they are the industries of the future .
how can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development ?
Mr President , may I commence by complimenting Mr Langen on his work .
the Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points : dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement .
so who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of ?
thirdly , we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law .
of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information .
while urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers .
it is therefore noticeable that &apos; equality &apos; , &apos; gender &apos; and &apos; women &apos; are barely mentioned in &apos; Shaping the New Europe &apos; .
we shall now proceed to the vote.1
an appropriate statute and the right of movement and settlement for residents of non-EU countries is something which the Spanish People &apos; s Party has been advocating for some time .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carried out by Mrs Berger and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market generally , which has incorporated innovative ideas into this directive , which I hope will be approved by the Commission and the Council .
Mr President , having devoted itself over the last 40 years to establishing a common internal market , the House now faces the major new task of creating an area of freedom , security and justice , a task which we will only be able to master successfully if all the institutions of the Union work together towards this ambitious goal with mutual respect and consideration for each other &apos; s competence .
KFOR and the UNMIC police consider one of their two main tasks to be preventing any form of maltreatment on the grounds of a person &apos; s ethnic origin .
indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes , provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition .
it also , of course , damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital .
I fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions .
I hope that honourable Members will excuse me if I am not able to stay to the end of the debate as I would , in all normal circumstances , wish to do .
this is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States , which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid .
everyone knows that the peace process is a protracted and difficult affair but we are convinced that , with the necessary trust , perseverance and indispensable political will , our common goal , namely a peaceful and prosperous Middle East , will be achieved .
Mr President , I am grateful for the Council &apos; s oral , and also written , reply .
although I wholeheartedly support this aim , I would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether .
I suggest that you clarify this matter at that time , if you so wish and if Mr Prodi agrees .
I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals they have put forward and I am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will ensue here in the European Parliament , on all the issues you have raised .
however , this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources - 50-80 % - will be reserved for cross-border cooperation , for INTERREG IIIA . therefore , we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand , regarding the selection of eligible regions , is wrong and contradictory .
there are two points which , in my opinion , deserve special attention on the part of the ELDR .
as the French say , &quot; ne jettons pas le bébé avec l &apos;eau du bain &quot; &#91; let us not throw the baby out with the bath water &#93; , that is to say , in the protection of the Community &apos; s financial interests , we must respect , on the one hand - as Mrs Theato has said - the competences of the Member States , but also other matters which affect the citizens , which affect the essential guarantees .
at midday , Mr Gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by Europe to the region .
because LEADER is a kind of workshop with a bottom-up approach , a huge number of ideas have come to fruition in recent years through LEADER I and II which of course at some point will no longer be brand new or as successful as they once were .
this is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have .
today , Europe is facing a similar challenge , and we know that , just as history has been unforgiving in the past , it will not be forgiving in the present .
Israelis and Palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum .
youth , education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values , for giving the citizens confidence in the European Union and making it credible in their eyes .
and finally , Mr President , frankly , I am not going to give examples , but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy .
subject : depleted uranium weapons Has the Commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon EU states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Kosovan conflict ?
this is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it .
I can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked .
social exclusion , the programme for women , the efforts we are making in the social protection area , everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society .
our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the House when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the Commission today , well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago .
my group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent .
there is nothing unusual about what is happening in Austria : there has been a changeover of power following democratic elections , in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found .
of course , every instance of a deprived urban area is a separate case .
what it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice .
let me explain .
according to the Commission , external policy can succeed , provided everyone knows exactly who is in charge !
the problems in Europe &apos; s urban areas are getting worse ; fortunately , we now have consensus with the Commission .
at this stage , there can be no delay in the process of reforming the Commission , demanded by our citizens .
this is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see .
we have opened this chapter with the White Paper on Food Safety : we now need to make significant headway in the environment sector .
as far as we are concerned - I am responding to Mr Seguro who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects , even though I do consider them as priorities , and consider that they must be dealt with now .
the mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which , through an exaggerated supervision of detail , prevents the development of a modern administration .
clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue .
the next item is the report ( A5-0104 / 1999 ) by Mr Koch , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94 / 55 / EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road &#91; COM ( 1999 ) 158 - C5-0004 / 1999 - 1999 / 0083 ( COD ) &#93; .
hence , to my mind , that includes having the courage to amend Article 4 of the EC Treaty , which defines the Union in traditional neoliberal style as an open market economy with free competition . the same applies to Article 105 , in my view , for the European Central Bank must at last be given the political task as enshrined in the Treaty , of using its monetary policy to promote sustained growth and employment .
I am happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re-worded form .
I think , therefore , that paragraph 7 contains something very central , i.e. that EQUAL will be used as a testing ground for developing and promoting new ways of delivering employment policies .
the issue is as topical as it was before .
even by this stage , that is already too many by far .
our programme highlights the major points of reference , the major areas for action : firstly , the development of new forms of governance for Europe ; secondly , extension and enlargement of the area of peace , freedom , and security ; thirdly , the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy ; fourthly , safeguarding and improving quality of life .
in other words , we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics .
we need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit .
thank you , Mr Bowe , for that question .
since the author is not present , Question No 13 lapses .
at the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track .
we also , however , deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country , especially one which is part of the European Union .
it is clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the Union will be raised at the IGC .
Commissioner , I believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures .
nevertheless , I recommend that we start , in the hope that the Commissioner will be able to follow the debate , and particularly the rapporteur &apos; s speech , from her office , if that is where she still is .
it is good that URBAN is to continue , as it has had good results at local level .
this is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogations .
an unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process .
the Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997 .
I would like to ask what new steps the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks , in particular , against the ranch and factory-style production of the USA and New Zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for European farmers extremely difficult and where , of course , European standards of food safety do not apply .
allow me also - listen carefully to what I am saying now , because I have heard this reiterated in the debate - allow me to comment on the issue of vintage and &quot; cherished &quot; cars as mentioned in Amendments Nos 3 , 7 , and 9 , section 2 , and 35 .
everything is done to make the lines of responsibility , the identity of the owners and real decision-makers as impenetrable as possible .
concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully .
in this respect , we should heed the words of von Eieck , and doubtless also those of the great Italian liberal Bruno Leoni , who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policies .
that is why the services are already trying to revise the text , simplify its structure and make its wording easier to grasp .
on the other hand , the European Regional Development Fund , the ERDF , also contributes as part of its role to promoting social and economic cohesion , by redressing the main regional imbalances and encouraging rural areas to take part in development and conversion .
but , Madam President , my personal request has not been met .
the renovation project , which lasted for months , cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe .
Madam President , I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that , during this first part-session of the new year , the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably .
the question is whether the Union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a Member State which includes such a party .
that is what I am asking President Prodi for at this moment .
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms .
however , if your response was to be that we should turn to &quot; Mr CFSP &quot; , that is , to Mr Solana , then I fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter .
Commissioner , the ignorance of certain Member States has landed us in a major food crisis here in Europe , and I am afraid that once more I have cause to be angry at the fact that again no Members of the Council are in attendance , and that on the day that you present your interesting report .
that is precisely the time when you may , if you wish , raise this question , i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report .
the second is that the translation services of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice should be separated .
I would like to remind those who seek to eliminate the right of small Member States to nominate a European Commissioner that the United States of America gives smaller states the same recognition as larger states in the United States Senate .
I therefore welcome with open arms the percentage levels for re-use and recycling which have been proposed by the Council .
urban is designed to find solutions to urban decay , and this is something of great concern to the elderly and therefore of great concern to the Pensioners &apos; Party .
obviously , I cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here , but I shall go directly back and see what I can obtain in the way of information about this particular case .
if we do reduce it , we remove from manufacturers the incentive to design and produce cars which give rise to less waste .
and , when we recall that , like many others on all sides of this House , my and my colleagues &apos; instincts are naturally aroused .
that is where we really get into difficulty .
it also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons .
absolutely , Mr Napolitano . thank you .
allow me briefly to comment on some of the assumptions and principles behind the present directive .
although a study produced by the Commission would doubtless be interesting , we do not need another to add to those already available .
we cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short-term sales of foreign currency and shares .
in the meantime , I should like to observe a minute &apos; s silence , as a number of Members have requested , on behalf of all the victims concerned , particularly those of the terrible storms , in the various countries of the European Union .
I would therefore appreciate your support for Amendment No 45 .
these are three areas in which many Danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squeezed out of their markets .
the European Commission &apos; s belief that , in all quarters of the Union , legislation will , almost as a matter of course , be interpreted in the same way , is what , within catholic circles , we term &quot; foolhardy , &quot; and this is not allowed .
national states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control .
is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean ?
in addition to this one overture there is a second which we have already suggested to the Member States : greater financial flexibility between strand A and strand B. Thanks to these two overtures , especially the first , I can say that the Commission is willing to examine the case of Italian regions and regions of third countries around the Adriatic in order to promote the most appropriate cooperation under INTERREG , and with other instruments too , as soon as they become available .
for me there is no question of allowing them to develop and to flourish without fighting with all our might .
it is , of course , only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry .
however , for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance , freedom of movement is still highly restricted .
now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700 , bring in 26 % more population over time , and then adopt the Commission &apos; s , I think ill-considered , proposition , that there should be a European list of candidates .
this would be a minimum requirement , I believe , on the dawn of the third millennium .
the danger is too great for us to ignore .
what is the Commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training ?
equal remains crucial also to regions like my own , in the east of England , outside the principal funds of Objective I. We have had an extra incentive to take up Community initiative funding and an excellent record in response .
the Commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the Danish Government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach .
we believe in &apos; one man , one vote &apos; more than &apos; one share , one vote &apos; .
so the honourable Member &apos;s remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made .
I believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours , Tom Spencer . he suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women , we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time .
this is just a political fact about which little can be done at present , I think .
the Union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy .
I would compare the situation with an earlier generation &apos; s introduction of the Plimsoll line , a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels .
in other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important &quot; Amsterdam leftovers &quot; .
this has been compounded , so some who advise me believe , by the Rules of Procedure in the French courts which make it well nigh impossible for non-French nationals to proceed against the French Government .
Europe as an area of freedom , security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors .
thirdly , we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports , that is in every port of the European Union .
but the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted , as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme .
have you received any notification of any Members leaving the Group of the European People &apos;s Party or does the Austrian People &apos;s Party continue to sit in that political group ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as part of the reform of the Structural Funds the Community initiatives are being pruned to a total of four .
Mr President , the truth is that the news of the indefinite suspension or delay of the talks between Syria and Israel is not good news , but nor is it good news that the day before yesterday there was another bomb attack which injured 16 people .
Mr President , in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning .
this is not just about bureaucratic reform , however ; rather , it is about showing good will towards the citizens .
we are , therefore , in agreement with the report , Commissioner , as well as the broad outlines of the White Paper .
as far as Parliament is concerned , it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired .
you ought to also be able to draw conclusions at the IGC .
none of us wants South American type favelas in Europe .
secondly , we should indeed set up a European Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office with two tasks , firstly to assist the national public prosecutors , helping bring criminal proceedings in European fraud cases and , secondly , to supervise Europol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision .
we therefore think that all the measures we have highlighted in terms of long-term strategies , regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term , some of the homeless may be dead , will help us to guarantee sustainable policies in the European Union .
if there is a choice between investing in innovation projects or injecting most of the funding into bringing on deprived areas , we would opt for the latter as this does the most to benefit equality .
no amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday .
we were among the small number who denounced the communist dictatorship .
the Commission can also approve Amendment No 26 with certain editorial changes .
therefore , the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context . instead , it is a question of political decision-making and of the bases for this .
now that financing is readily available across national boundaries without any difficulty the same approach will obviously be strictly necessary , all the more so as we consider that an enormous amount every single day is employed in speculative transactions .
I am not going to mention the length of this report .
this message must be very clear ; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow .
finally , we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent .
the Barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party .
at the end of six months I hope that the music is still playing and that the European people are still listening .
there was a clear agreement , good or bad I will not say , but there was a contract . there was a clear understanding between the Commission services and the Committee on Budgets that there was agreement on Amendments 4 and 7 , i.e. on the idea of linking the mobilisation , the implementation , of the second tranche of macrofinancial aid to the condition that donors should first have fulfilled their relative obligations in terms of payment .
Mr President , I shall be speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , but also as an elected representative for Brittany , and I am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events .
the joint debate is closed .
various local authorities around the North Sea provide a prime example of this .
if we find that any Member of this House or their employees collaborated with the BBC in this farrago we will expose them to the opprobrium of this House .
I shall therefore , with your permission , give the floor to Mrs Banotti to reply to you under the procedural motion .
once that is done , issues such as liability can be addressed .
as the House knows and has repeatedly said , the scale and scope of the Union &apos;s financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures .
I hope the House will understand that .
I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes .
in the UK the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and statistic to help determine not only EU but national and regional assistance programmes .
the fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned , permitting greater use of Community law , which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply .
this is why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not alter its essence .
I fully support the statements made by Commissioner Prodi in today &apos;s session .
we must reduce protective tariffs in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertakings in the processing industry .
it would be Europe &apos; s undoing if we were to end up with just a few multinationals and no future for small and medium-sized businesses in Europe .
greater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness , because the money should not be squandered recklessly .
I would point out that the European Union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and , like Mr Désir and several other speakers , I feel that the European Union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect .
decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry .
this is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld .
Mr President , with regard to the various initiatives which we are analysing this afternoon , I would like to concentrate strictly on one of them , that is , the URBAN programme .
Mr President , we are indeed now in a very rare situation : those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the Council in their common position .
the main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision .
in this sense , the USA is not only our partner ; it is also our competitor ; not our opponent , our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model .
we look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents .
this does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds .
all this would be established by two regulations , one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code . the regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty , i.e. based on secondary law , whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible .
on the other hand , I am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common European legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime .
the citizens of the European Union expect solidarity , also from within this Community .
it is necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all levels of authority and to be partners , rather than competitors when it comes to policy .
a few salient points : the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect , especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours , including those of a financial nature .
who pays for the collection , the dismantling , the disposal and so on ?
our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today : this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational , neo-nazi element in Europe is extraordinary .
the report on so-called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts .
this is all I am talking about here , just that .
prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available , so that the right action is taken in good time .
what steps will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget ?
Mr President , I would like to point out that I voted for this report on sustainable urban development , known as URBAN .
this makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind .
the following objectives were set : improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative ; promoting the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector ; disseminating this knowledge to other rural areas .
Heaton-Harris ( PPE-DE ) .
I would like to remind you that these initiatives are aimed , firstly , in the case of URBAN , at improving the quality of life of the citizens who live in the poorer parts of various European cities , and , in the case of INTERREG , at facilitating cohesion and recognising the diversity and potential of the regions of the European Union , particularly by including the outermost regions in strands B and C.
I think , however , that instability is merely a symptom and that we should be looking at the underlying causes . I think that it is preferable to fight the causes rather than attempt to tackle the symptoms when this is probably not possible and when , as already stated , the measure concerned is pretty certainly at odds with the Treaty of Rome .
let us consider the scenario whereby the Commission , not believing itself to be equal to the task , wishes , or proposes to shed , for example , its powers to implement common policies , which it is nevertheless accorded by the Treaty .
it has been said more than once : justice delayed is justice denied .
in April 1999 , the Commission adopted new Rules of Procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment .
so , judicially , something needs to be done .
instead , communities in urban areas should be encouraged to present integrated action plans to tackle their specific urban problems , using EU resources as a value added to local actions .
the BBC this morning reported that a British Member of this House , holding a senior position within his delegation , continues to offer strategic advice to private clients , but does not state in the Register of Interests who these clients are .
however , we have acknowledged that this is an innovative and very welcome initiative by the Commission .
I would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that .
the first concerns this Parliament .
it has also had the distinction of strengthening the role of local authorities , the non-governmental sector and local communities and of supporting new partnership approaches to urban regeneration .
there is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission .
in accordance with the principle of competition , the legislation has implemented Articles 85 to 94 , competition policy in the strict sense , and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition .
the one thing it will not do is solve the problem - it is a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut .
this downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German Länder .
this will be possible with action on the part of governments , and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development .
it is the young people who are disappearing , who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas , all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas .
the Council therefore expressed its satisfaction , in its December conclusions , at the substantial contributions announced by the European Commission , which will indirectly assist in returning the situation to normal , together with similar contributions made by Member States .
I congratulate the rapporteur Karl von Wogau , who takes up the theme but also makes quite plain his demand for clarification , indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken , and pulls no punches when it comes to the problems currently under discussion .
where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible .
we urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible .
this Parliament has also asked the Commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 March of this year .
there was also an observatory under LEADER I and LEADER II .
last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed .
it is extremely important that the two European institutions involved in these negotiations , the Commission on the one hand and Parliament on the other , alongside the Council members , explain clearly to the citizens of the Union continually , every day , what the issues of this conference are and what responses we advocate in our capacity as European institutions responsible for ensuring both the proper operation of this enlarged Union and the common interest .
question No 9 by ( H-0798 / 99 ) :
if we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report , we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities .
the Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations , but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action .
it is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards .
- ( SV ) The parliamentary process concerning this question has been confusing , to say the least .
it is therefore not out of the question that these issues , which crop up again and again , and which are passed from one conference to another , may be addressed .
I shall also mention the German Socialist Party which dares to preach to us about the second world war , when it is international socialist in the way that its peers were National Socialists , still goose-stepping , the party of the Waffen SS ...
I am only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs Morgan , because she wants to scrap it altogether .
in my opinion , we should look further into this point , and I also think that the Marpol Treaty , which comes into effect in 2001 , should be looked at very closely .
many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way .
we want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdles are created vis-à-vis the business world , but once these have been overcome , implementation is as easy as it possibly could be .
the means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the Financial Regulation in April .
Madam President , this is an historic moment , as it is now , at last , quite clear to us all that the European Union has gradually developed into a community of values .
firstly , fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently , thanks to Commissioner Monti , there have been direct provisions , the code of good conduct in particular .
there will be no meeting today in Shepherdstown but we must hope , as Mr Patten said just now , that this postponement of the negotiations due to Syrian requirements will only represent one more step on the road to a peace agreement which will change the face of the Middle East .
to conclude , I want to welcome the Commission &apos; s XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy , on which , once again , a good deal of work has been done .
the Commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it .
according to its President , it is in a position to do so .
Madam President , under Rule 29 ( 4 ) you should be kept informed by political groups of any Members who have joined a new political group or who have left a political group .
the precautionary principle is not a new concept .
this is very good , and we are pleased to see it .
we are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services , in memory of the victims of the Paddington rail disaster , killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations .
cross-border services
I want to start by saying that I am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle , and it has been written together with David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen .
the question of renationalisation : first of all , although it is not really necessary , I would like to point out and stress , several times if I may , that the White Paper does not affect mergers or State aid in the slightest - we are not looking for devolution in these areas - but that , as far as Regulation 17 is concerned , there is a risk of renationalisation .
it must clearly be accepted that the people should be free to make their decisions at the level which best combines the objective conditions of an immediate , fair and transparent democratic debate , namely at national level in the main .
Mrs Myller then asked me about the location of the Authority .
how will these people be selected ?
in light of what I have said , I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you , so that on 14 February , the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives , Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos , can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament &apos; s backing .
judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months , this could well be the case .
however , we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout .
the first concerns the manufacturer &apos; s unrestricted liability to take back end-of-life vehicles .
nevertheless , we definitely have to do more .
Madam President , may I first thank Mr Graça Moura for weaving his way through the rather tough textiles and fibres that have made up this conciliation tapestry .
quotas are not , therefore , the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility , just one of many .
we have set a figure of USD 180 million ; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments .
the next item is the report ( A5-0010 / 2000 ) by Mrs Ahern , on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee , on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE ( C5-0334 / 1999 - 1997 / 0371 ( COD ) ) .
this issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms .
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
nevertheless , as you know , this issue is now in the hands of the European Commission and it will have to take this further .
we want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the European Parliament , without hampering the work of Europol .
.
as such , while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science , as some have alleged , it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics .
McCarthy report ( A5-0026 / 2000 )
I want to emphasise , however , that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduced by the Commission , it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the Commission .
Mr President , a third of EU money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes .
we need structural reforms in the European economy .
we need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports .
Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that .
to conclude , I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity . I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes , they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across- the-board regulation by Europe .
dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between Israel and its neighbours to the north ?
Europe &apos; s message , the European Union &apos; s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism , no ; it must be one of cooperation , partnership and peaceful development .
two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report .
I think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time-consuming explanations of votes .
he is absolutely right to say that a Union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much devastation in the Balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise , had we taken more pre-emptive measures if those had been possible .
firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the loading and unloading operations related to such transportation have been obliged , quite rightly , to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention , whether road , rail or inland waterway transport is involved .
a second remark made by Mr Gasòliba was that there is currently no evidence that the Tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rates .
I will tell you a few things we should do .
we need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme .
I expect that we will achieve an excellent result in the reconciliation and that the efforts to achieve a better living environment will triumph over unreasonable industrial requirements .
we had Commissioner Patten speaking in this House in defence of freedom , security and justice and yet his report before the British House of Commons this afternoon , which has been accepted , will do away with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its reserves and put the people of Northern Ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists .
nevertheless , we must stress that many people are aware , as they were yesterday too , of the risk that enlargement could compromise the original plan for the construction of a political Europe , a risk that was , moreover , indicated in an interview that surely escaped no one &apos; s attention , owing to the authority of the person being interviewed - Jacques Delors .
I particularly welcome his recognition of this virtuous circle of having sustained growth : the information society in an expanding European market with the addition of a fully functioning single currency which will give us the opportunity to genuinely promote prosperity , innovation enterprise , the entrepreneurial spirit and yes - most importantly of all - extra-high value sustainable jobs for our European citizens .
this is a useful measure and it is one which we all need .
we share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history , in particular World War II , but also its policies on enlargement , on immigration , on race and its attitude to the European Union itself .
in my judgement , this constitutes a guarantee to both sides , both from a political and a financial point of view , of the commitment they can expect from the European Union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for .
an alternative to the European Public Prosecutor could be Eurojust , as proposed at the last Summit .
it is in fact about protecting the euro against counterfeiting , which is an extremely urgent matter .
a better solution would be , as indeed the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism suggests , strengthened coordination between LEADER + and the Community cooperation and partnership programmes , such as INTERREG , PHARE , SAPARD or MEDA .
it allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question .
with the convening of the forthcoming IGC , the process of European Union is topical once again .
we agree with this approach and despite the lack of funds , this evening &apos; s result will serve to greatly boost this strategy and this opportunity for Europe , which will then give rise to an economic factor and a growth factor ; culture then , and an institutional aspect , the basis for structuring a vast community , a prerequisite for economic growth , and not the complete opposite , as Europe , in its cultural habits , has perhaps been used to viewing things in the past .
this is , and will continue to be , connected with developments within the World Trade Organisation .
this report which I voted against is less concerned with human rights than with &apos; communitisation &apos; or the consolidation of Fortress Europe .
previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out .
the cost is not insurmountable ; nor is the task an impossible one .
it is a structure to which the European Union has given as much support as it can and to which the countries of the European Union have contributed in various ways .
how strongly is the single market established at the moment ?
Parliament asked the Commission to waive its excessive privileges .
yet , there is some risk of dilution of effort . if we pursue too many objectives , our overall effectiveness suffers .
the Commission considers that the type of phasing-out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view .
the comments contained within , under eight headings , are an integral part of the discharge , the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision .
Madam President , reforming and democratising the institutions of the European Union are central to the historic and moral challenge of the enlargement process .
both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings , as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party .
first of all the report reveals Parliament &apos; s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions flawlessly .
according to the terms of the directive , the employer would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employee concerned .
do not continue in this vein !
I simply wish to remind you that the European Parliament has already sent a letter to the three kings through its reports .
culture 2000
I would point out that there is no European legal system , but that a different legal system exists in each Member State .
as for the argument that this initiative would increase uncertainty , very short-term capital movements are specifically intended to play on uncertainty and to bet on changes between currencies or various short-term financial assets .
Mr Haider has demonstrated , over the past years by both words and deeds , that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse .
the only merit of this directive is that it looks to the future .
that would be another way of spurring the reform process on .
at best this report simply corrects certain aspects and effects of the crisis . yet only scandalously limited resources are available for this work .
we also welcome Amendment No 13 insofar as , as a result of this , the card &apos; s area of applicability is extended from one Member State to all Member States .
ensure too , that training becomes a management tool .
I refer principally to the Palestine-Israel question , but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the Golan since 1967 and in southern Lebanon since 1982 .
numerous very difficult questions are bound to arise , but the only real problem which I can see so far is one of political will and the St. Florian principle of shifting responsibility from one agency to another which has now taken hold .
the settlers at the Golan Heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security .
nevertheless , it is still regrettable that the European Union , one of the most important financial donors , is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process .
between EUR 1 500 and 2 000 billion are traded every day on the financial markets . in three or four days , this can equal the total figure of annual global production , or global GDP , of approximately EUR 6 000 billion .
the Council must start by at long last ensuring that EURODAC is adopted in order to create the basic requirement for classifying asylum seekers .
during these years , the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport .
let me reiterate the comment which Doris Pack has just made and stress that we , the Members of the European Parliament , must fulfil our own obligations in this regard , while ensuring , of course , that we are not the only ones to do so .
so , the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the European competition culture - where today various small plants thrive , and they are certainly not all the same .
we , as the Committee on Transport , are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and , of course , we are likewise prepared to discuss , at a later date , the legal implications of this communication .
thank you , Commissioner Schreyer .
the problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted .
Mr President , my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the URBAN initiative , in Ireland in particular , has been quite successful and I am keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area .
subject : community EQUAL initiative On 13 October 1999 , the Commission adopted the Community &apos;s EQUAL initiative , the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asylum-seekers .
that is the way it should be .
it is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it .
former ADAPT projects range from the CORE project , which has developed new supply chains for the car industry in Bedfordshire , to projects to raise standards in small businesses in Hertfordshire in Essex .
still relating to Thursday &apos; s sitting , the PPE Group has requested that Mrs Cederschiöld &apos; s report on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro should be brought forward to Wednesday as the last item on the agenda .
of course I , in no way , agree with the publicised statements of this right-wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any downplaying of the Hitler regime .
the result is 30 % growth , so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result .
reading only one sentence which my friend , Mr Vidal-Quadras , has previously mentioned , &quot; The nation is defined by its location , culture and race , locally , ethnically and culturally . &quot;
the proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative , but Europe is a legal construction , its courts are central to its proper functioning .
subject : measures to combat the continuing ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Romanies in Kosovo On 2 December 1999 , NATO &apos;s Defence Ministers made a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo &apos;s minority communities .
we did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic .
I consider technical support to be necessary but , given the problems with the former TAOs , no new TAOs should be set up without Parliament &apos; s approval so as to prevent political responsibility from being passed down to the technical assistance level .
that is our role and this is the point of my question .
we must do this for the sake of the environment .
I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace .
there can be no worse situation than that of an elderly person living in a city .
Madam President , Mr Bolkestein , the ignorance surrounding this debate is unbelievable .
on the subject of these two initiatives , then , with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regarding regional planning and on future financial perspectives , let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and its committees .
for example , in my own region , in Manchester , the URBAN Community initiative has been a tremendous success .
the main responsibility for increasing the use of renewables is to be borne by the Member States .
this has worked fairly well , but , as in the famous film Casablanca &apos; time goes by &apos; and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances .
sadly that is the case and we must face facts .
then you decide to take a measure or not , to take action or not .
national competition authorities were able to apply Articles 81 ( 1 ) and 82 for some time .
during the new programme period , in view of enlargement and bearing in mind that funding has been provided for from new financial instruments and regulations , such as ISPA and Sapard , it is considered absolutely essential to coordinate the funding of all three strands of INTERREG with other financial aid to third countries .
Turkey &apos;s nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey &apos;s political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons , as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan .
as Liberals and Greens , we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look , but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives , and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems .
we must win back their faith in EU politics .
the forthcoming Lisbon Summit on these issues - dissemination of technology , employment - will be a decisive summit .
what I asked and what I am once again asking is the following : what are the views of the Portuguese Presidency on , for example , the appeals made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion , the division of work and social security , the implementation of tax policies , particularly for speculative capital , and the policy of redistributing wealth ?
we have seen the NOW project helping 70 women to return to work in Suffolk , many of whom were able to come and share the results of their experience directly with us at the European Parliament in Brussels .
they are just as prepared to take on board the fact that Austria will go from being a revered country to a reviled one , as they are its threatened isolation and thus to some extent that of its citizens .
nevertheless , at the last Fisheries Council of 1999 , held on 16 and 17 December , the Member States involved in this area of fishing , namely France , Spain and Portugal , considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a TAC reduced from 5 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes , as the Commission proposed , was excessively cautious .
of course capital markets need clarity - that is actually the idea .
where would Europe &apos; s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture ?
the responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer .
it is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility , irresponsible charterers , untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies .
medicines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them cheap enough for the people in Africa .
Mr President , today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony .
it is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal .
concerning Mr Evans &apos; point regarding the implications for businesses , it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted .
I should like to end by saying that the planning of the new inter-state cooperation zones has taken no account of the Mediterranean &apos; s geographical peculiarities , which would justify the creation of a special zone for coastal and island regions .
the Union professes its faith in its fundamental values in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the institutions of the EU confirmed this faith once again when the new coalition was formed in Austria .
the first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major , although not decisive , factor in reducing regional inequalities .
this is undoubtedly a complex issue , and one where we should like to see the Commission informing us of the latest development in the matter , particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and , as far as state aid is concerned , the need , in all probability , to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors .
I asked Commissioner Monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation .
that is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda .
I would like to make it clear that it is not just a question of finance or aid to the different social operators , but rather also of selecting those projects which are aimed at employment , or to put it another way , projects which will tend to favour the creation and promotion of jobs .
it is interesting for me , as a new Member of Parliament , to see that the budget provides for hundreds of millions of euros annually for tobacco cultivation .
the Tampere Summit was about combating crime .
the truth is though , that the Commission &apos; s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives .
( NL ) That the Florenz report has caused such a stir has been proven by the powerful lobby machine which has been set in motion by both industry and the environmental movement .
for us new members , it was the first time , and this was a very interesting process .
Mr President , Commissioners , I greatly welcome the possibilities for increased trans-European cooperation under INTERREG , but my concern is that the proposal offers fewer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas .
Madam President , I had the same experience as Mr Medina Ortega yesterday .
I do not know , but one benchmark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together .
I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report , not a legislative proposal , and whether that is something I can competently do on Thursday .
in its numerous debates and its reports so far the European Parliament has openly supported the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference .
Madam President , President of the Commission , this is a vital document for the future and fate of Europe .
above all , it lacks drive in the sectors I have mentioned , for example , as regards the Balkans .
this House is therefore your ally but not one which is too accommodating . you must therefore listen to our opinions , one or two of which I wish to express in my brief speech .
this is not in itself anything dreadful , but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road , rail and inland waterways and incorporate these , as part of the acquis communautaire , as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states .
this has since been unanimously approved .
the first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the Intergovernmental Conference is to begin its work .
a genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the orchestration of coordination between the ESF and employment strategy . the fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme period implies that the Member States really do need &quot; guidelines &quot; .
that is something we do not want to see , and we have therefore voted against any such extension .
this is , of course , a highly sensitive issue .
also , ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these .
members of this House are today speaking out against a telegram from Mr Prodi to Chancellor Schüssel which , quite obviously , is not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeuvre .
that could convince people that Europe , in its governance , is not something run exclusively from Brussels , which concentrates and soaks up more powers , more decisions , more authority .
I have decided , in the end , that the most remote regions , to which I attach particular importance , will be given special priority in the context of the transnational strand of INTERREG , with a cooperation strategy which will aim at improving their links with their neighbours and other Member State regions .
turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations .
it is not , however , possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union .
it is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research , development , environmental protection and cases of company closure .
we do need to obtain , from the Commission and the Council , in other words from each of the governments forming the Union , a clear , positive or negative , political stance . they must indicate whether they are ready to defend , within competent public bodies such as the International Monetary Fund in the first instance , the appropriateness of such a tax within the other instruments needed to stabilise the international monetary system .
for the European Union of the future to be able to function more effectively , more democratically and with complete transparency , clearly what we need is an extensive and in-depth reform of the institutions and the way they work .
as a corollary , there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations .
that should be our task , not political posturing .
this issue , which has an impact on their everyday life , is a key issue as regards EU credibility .
of course we have pondered this issue , and we are still studying it extremely carefully , and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced .
they would then determine their own prices .
I welcome the statements by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an Austrian Government that includes Jörg Haider &apos; s party .
one of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam , who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago .
on behalf of my group , but also personally , I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respects citizens &apos; rights and guarantees , which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many States .
I would like to add that Amendment No 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable .
this is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions .
unfortunately , the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society . I note your comments with particular keenness , as you may expect , given that I too am Spanish .
in order to function , the market needs rules .
we wholeheartedly support the programme as it is now laid down in a consultative document and which is also included in the programme of Vice-President , Mr Kinnock , on behalf of the Commission .
today , we have arrived at the end of a long road .
Mr President , I should like to raise a point of order in relation to the activities organised today by the Association of Parliamentary Assistants in support of their call for a statute for assistants to be adopted as soon as possible .
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue .
Madam President , off the subject of aeroplane delays , I wish to apologise for the absence yesterday of my colleague in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , Caroline Lucas , who is a British Member .
the regions have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation of the guidelines , although this demand was often made in the debate about the reform of the Structural Funds .
we voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument , together with an implementation committee , which would be attached to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be .
as the report itself indicates , the funds allocated to the URBAN II programme for the 2000-2006 period are approximately 30 % less than those in the previous period , which were already low , at EUR 900 million . added to this is the fact that only about fifty projects are considered for the whole of Europe which is pathetic when practically all European city districts , both suburban and inner city , are affected .
we should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions , by protecting the Union &apos; s financial system with a substantive and procedural European law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the Community &apos; s economic life .
it seems over the top to us for other Member States to be given the option of systematically carrying out inspections systematically with a view to safeguarding public order before they issue cards .
the oral question ( B5-0004 / 2000 ) by Mr Désir and others , to the Council , on the Council position on the idea of a capital tax
the Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important , both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement .
I can see from your reaction that many of the Members of Parliament have not received the Minutes and clearly you cannot approve Minutes which you have not seen .
today , the new frontiers of European integration are political frontiers : common foreign and security policy , justice and internal security , and - to a lesser extent - the crucial question of the fundamental political values on which our coexistence is based .
why should it not be possible for the G7 countries , the other EU Member States , China , Singapore and Switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the Tobin tax ?
why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow , 3 February , as a matter of urgency , when we could wait , in a position of strength , until the opening of the Strasbourg part-session on 14 February , and thus force an agenda that is complete , and therefore consistent , on the Council .
in the case of a non-Schengen state , in the last paragraph of Amendment No 22 , that possibility is contemplated , and is perfectly expressed , and I believe this provides greater legal security .
we Swedish Christian Democrats also oppose any threats which have been made to delay the enlargement of the EU to the east if the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is not extended very considerably to include subjects in addition to those left over from the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam in 1997 .
we also have to think of the consequences , especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers .
Koch Report ( A5-0104 / 1999 )
we warn that this coalition , if it is formed today , unacceptably legitimises the extreme right , directly in contradiction with the principles of peace and reconciliation , which bring us together in this European Union .
at a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal .
we are debating nothing less than the presence in a Member State &apos; s government of a political force whose doctrine and principles are incompatible with the conceptual and moral bases of the Union enshrined in its founding Treaties .
I believe they gave him 28 % of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government .
it is also a matter of conviction .
if we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running , it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also , as far as possible , apply to every country .
this aid is considerably less than the previous period , 1993-1995 ( a 13 % drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8 % to 2.6 % in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector ) .
there is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission .
here , unfortunately , the European Parliament has bowed to the interests of industry .
you say that you will not hesitate to come to this House to request more resources for the Commission , but the Commission must be aware that we are walking on thin financial ice .
we are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures .
the Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values , whether it comes down to an economic free trade area , or whether , on the other hand , it has a greater ambition : the desire to be a supranational union , in ways that have yet to be defined , that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world .
only then does it stop being a question of economic usability and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives .
he or she already pays enough in taxes for this vehicle , which is a bottomless pit in financial terms .
I was asked to highlight the result of the storms in Ireland .
we should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too , but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily .
I would ask you , ladies and gentlemen , not to start a debate at this point . this was just a procedural motion .
in 1998 , the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany .
in addition , EQUAL should feed into the National Action Plans for employment and its implementation should be able to be monitored through these Action Plans .
firstly , I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety , be it on the roads , on the waterways or at sea .
better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals .
I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background , but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved .
the common position is a reasonable compromise .
my amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods .
and that is why we have SOLAS ( the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ) and MARPOL ( the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships ) , two conventions of the International Maritime Organisation which will eventually have to be made mandatory in all Member States of the Union and whose application will have to be monitored .
effective implementation of this initiative could have a cumulative result because it could inspire similar action at regional and local levels , thus increasing its political importance still further since women need to feel the effects of European policy in their day-to-day life in real terms .
Mr President , Commissioner , as a Member for the French Atlantic coast , for Vendée , I should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the Erika oil slick in the face of these disasters , caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us , but by a crime .
why ?
now who should pay the costs ?
who is imposing their will on the nations of Europe , daring to stop them choosing their own fate ?
furthermore , the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid .
in this Parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in Europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment .
though our proposal to withdraw political invitations to any Austrian government representative to this European Parliament has not carried today , I give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the powers of this European Parliament to combat the return of neo-Nazis to government in Europe can and will be taken .
Mr President , the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erstwhile Commission , to whom it was to be granted , had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a caretaker capacity .
that is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation , and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material .
in his report , Karl von Wogau manages to capture this very well .
the fact that tax havens are frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large European banks here at home must not be ignored .
your action programme and your objectives are reserved , even silent , specifically on the stimulation of public investment which is needed .
we should make a good deal of progress if the Commission were to adopt , as binding regulations , the ombudsman &apos; s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice .
when INTERREG is implemented , it will need to be coordinated and synchronised with the other financial instruments concerned .
this being the case , various amendments to the rapporteur &apos; s initial draft report were adopted in committee , particularly highlighting the need for effective reimbursement of aid found to be illegal as well as the establishment of a league table of results .
who will provide us with new jobs ?
I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratified this Agreement .
so today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion .
we are concerned , therefore , as others have said , at the number of amendments which seek to exclude even further some of society &apos; s most excluded , by aiming for a very narrow definition of &quot; refugee &quot; .
the position of Parliament in this whole procedure is somewhat unclear .
they need to see the political dimension working , to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens .
it is , of course , a peace process which is finally under way .
nevertheless , we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the Middle East of late .
my request to the Commission is that it should make sure that the organisations and sections of the population which get involved really are accepted .
today , we are already discussing the Austrian coalition government &apos; s policy on refugees because Mrs Stenzel , who is the author of the EQUAL report , of course represents Austria &apos; s governing conservative party and its policy .
what concrete measures have been discussed ?
by taking action in the field of culture , we are directly contributing to the construction of a European soul , especially given the fact that the sub-programmes which make up &quot; Culture 2000 &quot; are superb .
Commissioner , I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties , but I believe that , it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy , especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition .
question No 12 by ( H-0801 / 99 ) :
we need to be able to confront fears and anxieties , because in many instances the greatest fear is fear itself .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Schroedter , the rapporteur , for her work .
the development partnerships are a very clever idea , even though they are experimental .
so on the basis of the Treaty as it stands today , the EQUAL initiative is structured in that way .
I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment .
Africa has the largest number of refugees in the world , the most overall poverty and a debilitating AIDS epidemic .
I would also like to say a few words on Africa , Madam President .
Mr President , I am very glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so .
the report addresses this and proposes integrating action to achieve equality between women and men in all aspects of work ; it also recognises the importance of working with local and regional bodies which are those closest to the people to help ensure that all project results are mainstreamed .
if we look at the private sector , however , we will find not only that this fabled &apos; financial stability &apos; has been unsuccessful but that we are most probably sitting on a volcano ready to erupt at any moment .
many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern .
everything that I have just said , ladies and gentlemen , demonstrates that the Commission is resolved to taken the views of Parliament into account .
this is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre-requisite to the European Union &apos; s being able to function come what may .
we do not know what is happening .
lastly , we need to ensure that there is proper , genuine reform of the European Commission .
the situation of the Palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict .
Mrs Theato &apos; s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions .
Mr President , I am sure that Mrs Schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise .
the rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines .
the cost will not therefore disappear , but now we are clarifying whose liability it is and how the cost is to be distributed .
this is unacceptable in my view .
clearly though , it must be monitored , a task which falls to the European Commission .
this proposal is still being discussed by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure .
we must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment .
this is a creative initiative , which we know has been welcomed by different industries across the world and by various sides in European politics , but the Commission has not yet put forward any proposal or initiative on this issue .
if Europe has any meaning , and - my friends will pardon me telling them - if Christian democracy has any meaning , if the history of Christian democracy has any meaning , then it must declare itself radically opposed to the statements made in this manifesto and , whatever excellent reasons are given whenever history serves the same dish up again , must reject any agreement with this type of ideology and this type of organisation .
I therefore give the floor immediately to Mr Bourlanges , in his capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets .
in its resolution referring to specific atrocities committed against Serbs and Romanies , Parliament also vigorously condemns the continuing violence against the Serb population and calls on the leaders of the Kosovo Albanians to fully respect UN Resolution 1244 .
however , this report is based on long and effective work which has already produced certain results , such as the incorporation into the Finnish Presidency &apos; s document of 7 December 1999 of the commitment to widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation , composition and competences of the Community Courts .
intergovernmental Conference
Madam President , I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group , Francis Wurtz , reminded us of just now .
your question switched to the subject of arms , a broader policy issue which I do not think falls within the scope of this question but which the Council will , of course , address in the future , if it sees fit and if it decides to put it in a specific context .
we have taken almost eleven months - President Prodi was nominated at the Berlin Summit in March last year - to establish a legislative programme . this is not entirely President Prodi &apos; s fault .
I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues .
it is easy to see that the car industry in certain countries , for example in Germany , went in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive was adopted .
we will need the European Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office for this , which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees , also for suspects .
my question , which has not been answered , is why , when the European Parliament is looking to increase appropriations to fund cultural programmes within the European Union , the Council and the Commission are cutting back on appropriations and at times cutting them out altogether .
Madam President , I can assure your Parliament that my day-to-day work consists partly of attempting , in conjunction with my offices and colleagues , to completely integrate the financial markets within Europe , thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible .
( PT ) The Commission &apos; s main instruments for overcoming regional disparities are the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund . it is therefore crucial that the European Parliament drafts its broad indicative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity , given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective Member States .
we can therefore welcome its adoption .
where this aspect is concerned , we cannot accept any weakening of the Council &apos; s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force .
no , to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the Union .
the Commission proposal accords the Commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy .
no , you have not done so .
we will talk about this on another day .
finally , will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent , public way ?
I am very concerned about these translation problems which , unfortunately , we seem to be having increasingly , and I can assure you that we shall look into the matter very seriously indeed .
the European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets .
that is my judgement at the moment .
the problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong .
this has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about .
question Time ( Commission )
I am , up to a point , concerned about how the Council will fight for the principles contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam and whose purpose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to participate in the decision-making process .
thus , Mr President , I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission , as other speakers have done , to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000-2006 .
therefore , Mr President , our proposals , which we will specify in another report , together with the proposals of the Commission , which has produced an excellent document - and I am happy to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier - are going to be used as conference documents .
any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents , is bound to support this approach .
I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration , and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive , small and medium-sized enterprises , on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing , and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields .
the operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about .
we would like the Commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this .
secondly , encouraging exchanges , mobility and training in the cultural sector .
however , this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process .
I have to inform you , Commissioner , that both the report of the Wise Men and that of Mr van Hulten will become gauges for our group , gauges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not .
I regret the delay with which LEADER , as was the case with the other three initiatives , was presented to Parliament and for the knock-on delay this entailed for the whole procedure .
the Commission proposes redistributing the INTERREG funding as follows : between 50 and 80 % for strand A , 6 % for strand C , and the remainder for strand B , i.e. from 14 up to a maximum of 44 % .
it is a very clear answer , but it is also an answer , may I point out , which puts Danish organisations , the Danish Government and the Danish Parliament in a very , very difficult situation politically , for it is a well-known fact that there are a number of basic problems associated with the relationship between the Danish model , which is based quite obviously upon collective agreements , and the Continental model , which presupposes legislation .
if we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years &apos; time !
I therefore think that this issue should be included as a matter of urgency in the IGC agenda , and in itself this justifies a thorough revision of the Treaties .
they will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority .
that is why , when we look at the EU Financial Perspective between 1989 and 1993 , and 1994 and 1999 , we find such a large proportion of the EU budget was put aside for the administration of the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund .
you have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself , but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues , the ones where it hurts !
would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance , similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment ?
this is the citizen of a state &apos; s prerogative , for it is the founding principle of a democracy .
you have to see this as a tool for risk management .
tell the truth for once . you could not care less what the people of Europe want .
at the beginning it is sometimes a little like chasing a rainbow if we say that a plan is too idealistic .
when , in 1994 , over five years ago that is , I joined the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament , I became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier .
one example is the use of peat .
this aid must be aligned with the objectives of the Union , particularly economic and social cohesion , sustainable development and research .
the proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one .
does the Commission think that there will be never be any revision ?
( PT ) By proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy , the Commission is devolving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion . issues of mergers and state aid however , still remain within the notification system .
my country &apos; s place is not outside the European Union but in it ...
why , in these circumstances , is the liability of Total as charterer not recognised ?
this extreme difficulty in seeing the contradictions of the current situation and , where necessary , confronting these is seriously limiting the will , duly confirmed by Mr Prodi , to grant public demands .
the rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996 .
the key questions now are who pays the EUR 262 per car for the 9 million cars that are disposed of each year ?
Mr von Wogau said we can look to the European Court .
the proposed change will make the systems more effective , both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes .
this , however , does not seem feasible .
but all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of Parliament .
I would be grateful if you could be disciplined since we are running out of time , and this delay is going to limit the time available for Questions to the Commission .
we also take good note of the fact that the Member who has asked the question has applauded the Commissioner &apos; s answer .
however , in my view , he will be no more able or willing to be integrated into this , into our political system , and into the Europe of today , than any other extreme right-wing movement .
as I made clear in the hearings last September and on other occasions , we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed .
my investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case .
we have submitted an amendment to this effect .
unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise .
I have every confidence that if we and the politicians of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need .
we have also offered very substantial support to Jordan , Lebanon , Syria and Egypt .
that is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here .
I thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on .
trees have been uprooted , houses are still being demolished and , above all , water supplies have been reduced or refused , especially in East Jerusalem , while the settlements continue and are growing constantly .
as your rapporteur has requested , I shall send you the detailed information regarding the system for the implementation of this strand .
Mr Sjöstedt , the answer that I gave was the only answer possible .
equally , unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all , indeed they rose in some cases .
the bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments .
the European Union has an important role to play in the peace process , as all sides - Palestinians , Israelis , their Arab neighbours and the United States - have acknowledged .
nevertheless , it raises some very basic questions .
our answer to this crucial question is no .
Syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy .
of course we need to aim high , but quotas must not become an end in themselves .
we are pleased that all the rural areas of the Union may be involved in LEADER + , but we believe that it is necessary to concentrate Community resources in the less-favoured regions in order to facilitate the process of socio-economic cohesion within the Union , and that state governments should not divert these resources towards objectives other than cohesion .
the Commission attaches the greatest importance to this , just as you yourselves do .
in fact , taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade , and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States , the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements , and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion .
we would be changing the law to make it executable again , which is something I consider to be unacceptable .
I want to underline that point .
it may well be easy enough to change the Commission &apos; s organisation chart but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts , particularly those relating to budgetary discipline .
what we need , then , are basic administrative regulations for the EU , for its institutions and for the EU in its relations with the Member States .
my fear is that such deficiencies in EU legislation could lead to turf wars between national and EU bodies , who should be working together rather than against one another .
we have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted , doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs .
I agree that Article 13 contains something we have expressed our disagreement about , but that is how the Treaty stands right now and among the categories of types of discrimination , discrimination on the grounds of gender holds equal place .
another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful .
Mr President , it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation , particularly for women and young people , and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy .
on the other hand , the decision to delay the second round of talks , initiated in Shepherdstown by the Syrian Arab Republic , is undoubtedly significant , but I am convinced that the hopes which were raised on 3 January in that town will not be dashed .
Mr President , I am very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it has earned great respect in this Assembly .
there will be friendship , calm , openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process .
we need a body of food law , as you have said , and we need to agree this together .
subject : proposal for a regulation laying down the total admissible catches for specific fish populations for the year 2000 , and the case of anchovies in particular The latest reports from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea indicate that the current level of anchovy stocks in ICES zone VIII is critical .
today &apos; s political statement on this issue was very positive indeed , and one which I welcome .
the main danger awaiting us in the medium term is not inflation but deflation caused by the collapse of the speculative bubbles on the international financial markets .
I just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage .
in respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector , which will come into force in July 2002 , we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied , and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this .
Madam President , they say , where I come from , &apos; it &apos; s three times for a Welshman &apos; , and three times , as I think you will discover in the course of that debate , I signified my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent , and on several occasions , a moving debate .
it is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of EU enlargement .
by setting out in some detail how the Commission applies , and intends to apply , the precautionary principle , we hope to be able to clarify the situation at Community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at European and international level .
when it comes to pollution , like sin , we are all against it , but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good .
Mr Chirac has described those who engage in this as the Aids virus of the world economy .
I propose that we start the debate immediately .
you will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board .
it also appears in a range of international texts , for example , the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio-Safety Protocol .
we shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter .
they are trading this in for a head of government &apos; s position and for membership of a government .
the question of consistent application : the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind , but I do not believe that it should be exaggerated .
Parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated .
I support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels &apos; structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions .
that does not prevent these Member States from taking public-order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification .
it is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies .
however , criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee .
paragraph D of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at EU level .
I am mindful of the fact that it was in fact the European Parliament which made the political decision and supported the continuation of this initiative for the regeneration of urban areas in difficulties , in favour of sustainable urban development , involving at the same time this integrated approach , which we value , to handle the economic , social and environmental aspects simultaneously .
from a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks , if any , are limited to an area around the target .
Mr President , the waste from end-of-life vehicles is one of our really major environmental problems in terms both of the quantity of waste and of emissions of environmentally hazardous substances .
both documents , that is the Commission &apos;s document and the Ombudsman &apos;s draft , cover largely the same ground .
there too , people are being encouraged to pay their taxes , for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the EU and from other donors ; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources .
you stated that the new European government requires strong institutions , while the Commission wants to focus at the same time on its core tasks .
if Parliament votes in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control &apos; s proposal this week and grants discharge , then the Commission must not take this to be a blank cheque .
we are recovering from a crisis . however , I believe that , in the future , it would be appropriate for the investiture of the next Commission to coincide with the presentation of a legislative programme .
while there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement , for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far .
the one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport , which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive , is something which I would urge you to support .
we await the outcome with great interest .
the second proposal grants the same rights to self-employed workers who are third country nationals .
in addition , I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997 .
fulfil your obligations to Parliament in a generous spirit , thus preparing for the future .
the single market extending across that enlarged Union is going to be a colossal achievement .
the Social-Democratic Group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days .
a flexible EU which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries .
I recognise the relevance of the arguments that Mr Souladakis has put forward .
the Netherlands has an exemplary model for disposing of cars as per the wishes of the directive and the issue of whether the buyer of a new car should pay or , in the case of end-of-life vehicles currently driving around , the manufacturer , has nothing , absolutely nothing , to do with ecology ; it is a simple question of competition !
it is not worthy of being brought into this report either .
all of this must nevertheless be done whilst respecting a broad framework - that of the overall acceptability of any solutions we may devise to achieve these three aims .
that is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security , freedom , citizens &apos; rights and judicial cooperation .
in Europe , legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25 % of the incoming vessels according to the port-state control directive .
legal certainty is important for businesses : this is a subject , the importance of which the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , emphasised in her last intervention - and I am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market , including , in this case , competition .
secondly , to promote and stimulate economic activity and social life within these historic centres , within these old quarters of our cities .
the challenge of creating an area of justice and home affairs , of dealing with asylum and immigration and crime , is very political .
the prescribed objectives are most certainly viable and , in the Netherlands , a value of 86 % recycling has now already been achieved .
the French text contains the word &quot; refuse &quot; and the English text the word &quot; shall &quot; , which means that the Commission is to keep secret such information as is today available to the public , for example in my own country .
Mr President , I have a few very brief comments .
or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here , with all the obvious risks that this entails .
this is what is and was meant by the call for a European Constitution .
naturally , that they should be environmentally friendly , that they should be recyclable , that they should be fuel-efficient and that they should not pollute our environment .
it now appears that this desire is more serious .
what is more , the work carried out in Brussels should be of a much higher quality and be completely transparent , so that people might at least have some small sense of owning the process , now that Mr Prodi and his predecessor have taken their autonomy away from them .
it is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money .
during the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget .
this should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff , rather of the Court &apos; s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union .
I am not so sure that our Dutch Members will be reassured on the grounds that the Irish Members too are unable to receive a national channel .
how many meetings of the group have been held to date ?
it is hard to understand why the French and the Europeans allow something which the Americans refuse to accept , and why Europe , normally so quick to pass environmental legislation , has chosen to overlook the matter of maritime safety .
in my opinion , we should not jeopardise that common position , because it is a directive which we desperately need for environmental reasons .
perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activities do the European Union good , not harm !
we in Parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in Europe .
I think we need to retain it .
Parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy , as I did right from the moment I had my hearing , on 1 September , in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
it behoves all of us to do everything possible to ensure their survival .
we can only hope that it will , after all , be possible to persuade the Council to have a change of heart one day .
this is the philosophy behind the initiative ; the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies , non-governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible , so that it can get as close to the people as possible .
I think it would be a good idea if the Commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per Member State .
the rapporteur , Mr Koch , to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this , has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN , which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive .
does the Council believe that it is permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violates the originally established TAC of 33 000 metric tonnes per year , given the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stocks ?
although there is much that is good about the new directive , it is nonetheless not without its defects .
indeed , for some &apos; forestry &apos; districts , which have lost 20 % of their trees , this represents a huge loss .
I must respond also to the fact , of course , that there were references during the debate - and I use some of the words employed - to the ambiguity , the complacency and the fragility of the Commission &apos; s opinion .
I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy .
I wonder what kind of mediaeval bureaucracy is at work here preventing a Dutch channel from being transmitted by satellite .
one could do so once or twice , but I feel that the UN donors should contribute to this as well , for there is a very large hole , as yet unfilled , that we are unable to fill .
there is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars , recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts .
but on the whole , this only serves to prevent abuses ; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation .
there must be rules governing existing vehicles too .
personally I argued in favour of a rather harder line , and I supported Amendments Nos 1 , 4 , 6 , 7 and 8 , as well as the oral amendment tabled by the Socialist Group .
the most remote regions may benefit from support under strand B. The Commission draws up a list of priority areas and eligible measures which for strand A is not comprehensive , but is comprehensive for strand B. The Commission reserves the option to , at a later date , put forward topics it considers important to the exchange of experience and strengthened cooperation between regions , for strand C.
all this must lead us to intensify our action in favour of developing a common cultural area , within which our cultures can flourish further in all their unique features , in all their diversity , but may also be mutually enriched and the other citizens of Europe may participate fully in them .
competition yes , restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible .
the document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the European Ombudsman &apos;s office .
perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the Commission .
we were able , at the Istanbul Summit a couple of weeks ago , to meet and have discussions with some of the Central Asian republics .
however , the past year was positively marked by some momentous decisions , such as the decision to begin implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam , the decision to incorporate the Schengen Agreement into the Community pillar , and the decision of the Cologne Council to create a Charter of Fundamental Rights and the decision of the Extraordinary European Council in Tampere to bind the Member States to common directions , priorities and goals with a view to creating a common area of freedom , security and justice .
a disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline , and why ?
our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement , or at the Balkans .
we see enlargement as a process of partnership , not a process of &quot; them and us &quot; .
the plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so .
we could say that , in this state of affairs , we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and , hence the destruction of the countryside .
we therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact .
this document leaves out issues which clearly should have been included .
I think that we have just had a great political debate , equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it .
we need to see which concrete alternatives the Commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements .
I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U.S. authorities , and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims &apos; families .
if there is , we have generated it in this House in the past year .
Mr President , I would like to welcome the President-in-Office and his colleague from the Justice Ministry , Mr Costa , and to thank them for the welcome they gave my committee in Lisbon last week and the constructive meetings we enjoyed .
it must be visible .
I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work .
naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary .
not only the Alpine region , but all our countries are involved : the conditions are being created whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat .
question No 45 by ( H-0006 / 00 ) :
in particular , the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the Ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site .
the report shows that , in general , they are a long way behind EU countries , especially in terms of GDP per capita .
it is the world of the EU that the citizens are interested in , this is the one that counts in their eyes .
INTERREG is one of the four Community initiatives scheduled for the period 2000-2006 , and is the one with the largest budget for implementation , i.e. EUR 4.875 billion as opposed to EUR 3.604 billion at the present time .
firstly , although much progress has been made , and we could mention customs administration , bank administration or tax administration , it is true that we must continue to move forward .
moreover , it will only be possible to give the Commission responsibility for the tasks it takes on according to the actual powers it will be accorded .
in many ways , the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another .
I would like Mr Barón Crespo , who made the request , to speak to propose it . that is , if he so wishes , of course .
it is too high a price , not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the states which want to join the Union .
first , financial management and control within the Commission must be improved .
who would want this to happen ?
it is perhaps not by chance that the Conservative benches have emptied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western Europe over recent decades .
for this to be possible , what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions , but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Representatives of the Commission , it is a black day for Austria and for Europe .
perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime .
why did he not mention the fact that one of his own Liberal colleagues also has a consultancy that is under investigation by the BBC ?
I shall only add that it would be the least that Total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick .
we wonder if this is actually feeding the flames of xenophobia and the parties and people that support it .
if we have not been able to reach agreement internally , I wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners .
our thinking and our future actions must focus on respecting these values , which truly respect gender differences , not on some postulated sexual equality , which has its own intrinsic contradictions . in any event there are no grounds for resorting to the easy option of a quantitative policy , based on the use of quotas , contrary to the idea of citizenship which the Members of Parliament in the UEN Group set great store by , and whose probable consequences would be the opposite of the effect apparently sought by Mrs McNally &apos; s report , namely women &apos; s participation in careers in science and research in proportion with their merit .
after the planned accession of new Member States with their 100 million inhabitants , the prosperity level of which is at one third or two thirds of the average level of the current EU Member States , this squandering will generate even more protest .
this increased awareness does not , however , affect identity alone .
we must monitor compliance with environmental standards , employment standards , in order to prevent dumping in this area , and we must ensure scrupulous respect for property rights and the revision of state aid , which in many industries - as has already been said - distorts competition and destroys jobs within our own territory . to sum up , we should apply similar conditions that will prevent aid , internal distortions by other countries , from being transferred to the international arena , in other words , through trickery .
I also fully endorse his findings , in which , in particular , he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the Court of First Instance and providing the latter with its own translation service .
I believe - as I think we all do - that Portugal , its former president , Mr Soares , and its government , maintained a cautious and middle-of-the-road stance during the bombings in the Balkans .
the EU must not do him an invaluable PR service .
the second point is about scrutiny mechanisms .
Europe was born out of a desire for peace , freedom and tolerance .
firstly , we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds .
the Danish pension scheme , the Efterløn , only allows people resident in Denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in Denmark to retire .
finally , the Commission cannot approve Amendments Nos 1 and 33 for reasons to do with legal clarity ; nor Amendment No 19 , which the Commission considers to be unnecessary at this stage .
well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson .
the guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion .
in my opinion , there is too much initial hesitation .
frustration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the Convention ( and of the protocols relating to this protection ) which , five years after being signed , has still not been ratified and has still not come into force .
in this resolution , Parliament is assuming its responsibilities .
for that reason , the uninterrupted flow of assets in massive volumes between the world &apos; s financial centres is not merely speculative activity , which has nothing to do with the real economy .
it is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium , and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues , which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport , Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17 .
in the example which you mentioned , it is only logical that the teacher in a Catholic school should be Catholic .
the Council &apos; s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited .
we must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation , rather than monocultures .
Mr President , Commissioner , reading the leaflets which have been distributed in recent weeks , one would think that we were talking about the ultimate environmental catastrophe or the death of the car industry in Europe .
thirdly , the European Union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly .
this coordination is at present lacking , and the Commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it .
my own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on .
most importantly , we need to restore a European economy in which performance pays and people can work as entrepreneurs .
ultimately , we also need to achieve better cooperation , of course , between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts .
the answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken .
not only should the Commission discuss this , but also our states , our parliaments and our civil society .
whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency , which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end .
thank you , Minister .
the first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance , and that they should be given one more référendaire .
so what are we to do now ?
it would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite , at this time , into the institutions of the EU , a xenophobic party which flirts with Nazi ideas .
must there be an IGC ?
we think they should .
let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspects of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid , on average , for the period under review , is in the order of EUR 95 billion , corresponding to a reduction in the order of 13 % in relation to the period 1993-1995 , a reduction which is essentially due to a reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany .
firstly , we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96 / 35 / EC , which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training , instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly .
I urge that car manufacturers should most definitely not be given the task of organising the dismantling and recycling of vehicles , as they would gain an excessive hold over the second-hand components market .
today - and I must say this with pride and satisfaction - this Parliament has had a good opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which we Europeans believe that the European political project is much more than just an internal market , and that it is based much more on principles than on economic interests .
this question covers several individual matters .
a ) Sittings from 14 to 18 February 2000 in Strasbourg Relating to Wednesday :
I think that given the dramatic circumstances , and as a matter of principle , it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several votes .
moreover , I would like to say that I appreciate the remarks and observations that Professor Tesauro , Chairman of the Italian Competition Authority , sent me , and which I am sure Mr Monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen of the House , at this stage , following this debate which I have listened to most attentively and with great interest , I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi .
( it ) I shall now quickly turn , Mr President , to Mr Rapkay &apos; s report , and I would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endorsement given to the Commission &apos; s XXVIIIth Annual Report on Competition Policy .
finally , there is the lack of transparency .
a system , such as the current one , which is capable of making so few decisions , be they approvals or prohibitions , is something less than a valid system .
a system of this kind is not something the EU can introduce without society &apos; s sustaining damage as a result .
I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them .
speaking in this House on 21 July President-designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform , which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today .
the second area is that of freedom : freedom to move and reside wherever one wishes in the Union ; freedom of information ; freedom to vote for all who have European citizenship - and that includes not just Member State citizens but third country nationals .
thirdly , we have to bear in mind the synergies generated by other Community programmes , as well as the opportunities for sustainable development in the location or region in question .
the real culprits are Austria &apos; s Christian Democrat acting as Judas goats to resurrect a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945 .
thirdly , promoting cooperation between cultural operators .
as far as we are concerned , we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes .
secondly , we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation .
because of the situation in Austria , this is a dark day for Europe .
that is why this Parliament has put forward paragraphs 10 and 15 of the resolution , to ensure that Member States cannot ignore any one target group .
this is no longer tolerable .
on the one hand , by asking the Commission , within the scope of aid to the fishing industry , to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected , and also by asking them to demand , of international bodies and of themselves , tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience .
I took the punishment that came to me .
I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point , which clearly emphasises that it is only possible , and permissible , to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those Kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi-public , communal and other authorities and institutions , which are controlled either directly or indirectly by UNMIK .
the Council , Commission and Parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive .
question No 1 by ( H-0780 / 99 ) :
there is no reason why , against this background , we should agree to grant discharge .
so far , we here in Parliament have been positive catalysts for environmental protection but now , if the amendments proposed by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange are adopted , we are to become a negative factor for the environment in Europe .
the way to a European monopolies commission must be kept clear , something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion .
and indeed there is a twofold shift .
after having heard Prime Minister Guterres , the Minister of Foreign Affairs and yourself , I have confidence in the ambition of the Portuguese Presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiations .
of 47 states invited from all corners of the world , not one of them , however , is an Arab state included in the EU &apos; s Barcelona process .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road , which entered into force on 1 January 1997 , contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time , the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN , that is the European Committee for Standardisation .
most SMEs have in fact less than 30 % of the market share .
we know , and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed , including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year , that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings .
in such circumstances will it even be worth having elections ?
at the same time , we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the EU must be able to be held accountable in an effective way .
agenda
the next item is questions to the Council ( B5-0040 / 99 ) and the Commission ( B5-0041 / 99 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , on the 1999 annual debate on the area of freedom , security and justice ( Article 39 of the TEU ) .
it should not be dramatised into something more than that .
you have tacked a few components together but you have no overall structure .
here too we should continue along the path we have chosen , strengthening and intensifying it .
I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale .
all this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union .
the Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility .
we have amused ourselves with a pile of reports , but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives ; they have disappeared .
indeed , they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the Member States where a service had to be provided .
this is why it is useful for the European Union to continue to support the Member States and , if necessary , give additional support under URBAN .
let me remind you that the Erika was sailing under a flag of convenience , that of a state applying for membership of the European Union .
let me also remind him that when his party leader , Mr Hague , was Secretary of State for Wales , he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements .
I should further like to express major reservations with regard to the exaggerated tendency which , in the Commission communication with reference to INTERREG III and III B , involves associating environmental protection exclusively with the development of Natura 2000 , which I think is often an excessively abstract means of safeguarding ecosystems , from which users are in danger of being excluded or severely restricted .
the United Nation &apos; s , and Mr Kouchner &apos; s , mission in Kosovo ended in failure .
equal is a very difficult programme because it attempts to combine so many old programmes and yet aims to view them in a different light , doing so with less money than was available in the previous funds .
of course it is as you say .
it will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought , particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling .
globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification , just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean levelling of values or dampening of hopes and enthusiasm .
with global markets , we need global employment laws and global subsidies .
the issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential .
but we must look always to subsidiarity .
we need more police officers , as we have nowhere near enough .
what establishes a recognised minority ?
Yes , the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - is meant to be an independent body , but it also has to be accountable to European citizens through our Parliament .
unlike the previous speaker , who has now disappeared , my group is strongly in favour of a European Public Prosecutor .
does the Commission intend to do nothing - at least it has announced nothing - about this reform in 2000 either ?
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Mr President , the Union for a Europe of Nations Group considers that the agenda for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference , as set by the Helsinki Council , i.e. focussing strictly on the issue of decision making in an enlarged Europe , must be adhered to .
Mr President , the President of the Commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the Intergovernmental Conference .
however , the Commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the Authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the Commission , Parliament and Council .
valuable experiences were gained , and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone .
recently , because of political developments in Austria , there is growing unease within Europe . political demonstrations are taking place as well as political dialogue .
this solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs .
you are being realistic when you say that the welfare state can no longer provide adequate responses to the problems facing us , including unemployment .
I consider this to be unacceptable .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , you have talked a lot about the future , about what the Commission will do , and what the Presidency will do in Lisbon , etc . however , you also said something which I find particularly frightening .
it would weaken a key element of European policy .
you just have to think of all the resolutions concerning Fort Europa , Schengen , Eurodac etc . any democrat can spot two key problems .
but for my part , I am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts .
Europe is making its presence felt at a time when we are doing something for all the citizens of Europe and not simply for the development of an individual State , whichever one it may be .
we keep reminding them about Article 6 of the Treaty .
in principle , I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules .
you must embark on a dialogue with the international community .
the number of departments has been reduced .
I therefore , of course , support the European Parliament &apos; s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference .
however , we in the Liberal Group welcome this because it means we are now settling down to business .
have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself ?
the second subject is flexibility and simplification .
thus , a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amounts of recoverable material in their vehicles , to encourage private sector recycling companies , through a package of tax incentives and assistance on complying with environmental requirements , and to incentivise the use of recycled materials .
leader + should supplement already existing programmes , avoid overlaps and duplication of financing and thus contribute to a process of development which is as comprehensive as possible .
Mr Langen mentioned that a series of Parliament &apos; s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point , that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community .
in my opinion , this directive is unacceptable for this reason .
but the people asking the question need to know that not every instance of instability , as the Commissioner has just so impressively told us , is the result of speculation .
in the Netherlands , the competition authority is still in its infancy .
we know , I know myself , that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us .
the Union for a Europe of Nations Group , on the other hand , wishes to see a polycentric Europe with nations linked in a network .
it suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened .
I also refer to my explanation of vote of 18 November 1999 which clarifies my attitude towards supranationalism and common defence .
my second point is that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system , adopting common procedural rules and , above all , putting an end to the current confusion between migration for political reasons and migration for economic reasons .
all we would have to do is get a directory of development and put all the items in our programme , one after the other .
following a request to this effect , which I have received from a number of political groups , and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents which has just been held , I propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance , pursuant to Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure , on the subject of the European Union &apos; s reaction with regard to the talks in Austria on forming a government .
the idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK .
he said we must not always be carried along by lawyers .
he mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support .
today the republicans are no longer represented in most local parliaments .
I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area ?
we have dealt with other subjects and we have mentioned our idea that other subjects may be dealt with in this conference , if the Portuguese Presidency firstly , and then the French Presidency , so wish , in view of the serious nature of the present juncture prior to enlargement .
the recent dioxin scare in Belgium , prior to that the BSE crisis in Britain , and the continuing controversy over the safety of genetically-modified foods , have all contributed to undermining consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat .
we all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency , and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions .
the low rate Tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problems .
the change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned .
I voted for the resolution to adopt an opinion is in favour of convening the IGC . I did so because it sums up the philosophy of the Portuguese Presidency , which is supported by a broad majority in Parliament , of opening up the IGC agenda beyond issues strictly related to redressing the balance of power between Member States , large and small , as was originally stated when the Helsinki Council was convened .
let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development , unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland .
on the one hand , we have been asked to provide Parliament with information regarding the progress of invitations to tender and , in this respect , I can tell you that the Commission was last week able to provide Parliament &apos; s Committee on Budgets with the latest statement of contracts and payments carried out since the task force was sent into action in Kosovo .
I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this Chamber sound , the more applause they receive .
for instance , religious schools could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example : we do not want to employ you because you are a gay man or because you are a lesbian .
I would urge you to endorse this .
I believe that it is well worth insisting that we wish to participate more with regard to the Court of Justice , even in the appointment of judges .
I have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the Commissioner .
if Air France insists on boycotting the European Parliament , we should take measures to prevent this occurring again .
according to the Treaty , one of the founding principles of this Community is linguistic and cultural plurality and there is no question of our overlooking the possibility of something as important as being able to read a judgement in our own language .
... and that includes their representatives in this Parliament .
secondly , because it can promote recycling , which is important .
instead , there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily .
we are looking , therefore , within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality .
I think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the Commission &apos; s own scope for intervening , through its right of initiative .
furthermore , it should be the case that , if the Court of Auditors detects a mistake not just one year but two years running , the management should be held responsible for it , and this will have an effect on chances of promotion .
I , for my part , have focused on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme , and I have to say that their position could well have been overlooked altogether if it had not been for the European Parliament devoting special attention to them .
we have done everything to help liberalise financial transactions , but so far we have had no working set of rules , as we have learned from the bitter lessons of the repercussions of the Asian and Latin American crises .
finally , a compassionate thought for all the volunteers , nature lovers and bird lovers , who spontaneously and generously are coming through to the aid of the oil-covered birds , organising rescue operation with the means available .
Mr President , I would like to thank Commissioner Patten very much for the awareness he has demonstrated of the difficulties inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the European Union is taking on to bring it to completion .
thirdly - and perhaps this should be the first objective - the projects should principally be aimed at the complete rehabilitation of people and families , because man is not made for the law , but rather law is made for man .
- ( EL ) The Freedom Party &apos; s participation in the Austrian Government is a dangerous development for the European Union &apos; s political future .
I also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between INTERREG and the EDF , particularly for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean .
Madam President , the agenda has been rearranged so many times that I would simply ask the Chamber to support the present proposal .
on Friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda .
I also expect the Commission to be pro-active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures .
we are also doing a number of other things : in the European Union-China human rights dialogue , we have focused on a number of practical steps , including sending experts on assignment to Tibet , planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health , education and training for Tibetans .
Mrs Banotti apparently promised to write a letter explaining why permission was withdrawn but so far no letter has been received .
in my opinion , the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management , but each Commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general , empty proposals .
the Commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the European Parliament regarding the request made by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance . the purport of this request is , on the one hand , to transfer the assessment of certain appeals to the Court of First Instance , such appeals currently being within the exclusive scope of the Court of Justice and , on the other hand , to increase the number of judges at the Court of First Instance .
these are matters which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voters and no longer be able to change on election day .
before the end of March , I propose to present a communication in which I will possibly present legislative texts , that is to say , amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the Council and in Parliament .
this improvement has been achieved with fresh funds , as we said at the time , and it has been achieved while safeguarding this Parliament &apos; s prerogatives and competences .
my fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed , too extensive and too late .
however , we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place , precisely in order to facilitate enlargement .
where , above all , will the required money come from , and where should this observatory be located ?
someone planted a car bomb and one person has died .
here we find ourselves fundamentally at odds with last year &apos;s debate in the Council when freedom from costs for the last owner and the issue of financing were lumped together and a question mark placed over whether the last owner should really be free from costs .
so I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member has said .
what sort of impression will an interested public , as well as the rest of the world , have of this five-year programme ?
we genuinely share your concerns about the threatening situation which exists in Kosovo for ethnic minorities , for both the Serb and Romany populations , and the incidents of discrimination , harassment and intimidation which continue to take place in that region .
this question has now entered a different dimension , a dimension in which USD 1 500 billion roam the world twenty-four hours a day looking for attractive investments , no more than 3 % of which have anything to do with the real economy .
we are sure that there will be an important &quot; reform dividend &quot; as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources .
I will give you an example : the European Union was right to support the Grönitz steelworks in Brandenburg , although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained .
whether we are talking about beef to France or about backhanders to industry , EU Member States must not be allowed to flout the law .
we have a serious situation in which in the European Union today , there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty , as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached , on average , 23.7 % in the regions worst affected , regions which also happen to be poor areas , whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment , corresponding to the richer areas , unemployment stands at just 4 % .
Mr President , our committee views these issues very differently and , to start , I will speak from the point of view of research .
the results are clear in terms of the improvement of the quality of life in the target areas .
the Greek Government acknowledges the problem of its being unable to record human resources entering and leaving work and is therefore committed , firstly , to restructuring public sector employment services in Greece , secondly , to setting up efficient employment promotion centres - this programme has already started but has not yet been completed - and , thirdly , to introducing a system of electronic employment cards and using suitable IT systems to monitor all these policies .
in other words , to put it simply , Denmark has a choice : it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it .
that too is feasible .
the plight of small businesses is also addressed by numerous amendments from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the amendments in question from our group to Article 5 concerning costs .
I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and regions that have tragedies like this .
the traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit .
the confidence of millions of Europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this .
- The European Parliamentary Labour Party has abstained on the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulos Report .
Mr President , I would like to stress that , in an age of significant technological changes - just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport - safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future .
we have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judged according to how we fulfil it .
there are risks , as we are all aware , but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach .
to respect my speaking time , I will confine myself to referring only to the broad outlines of my programme : a programme for the dawning of a new legislature and a new century , when it is right and proper to see Europe in a broader perspective , a Europe which is currently in a paradoxical situation .
and I shall end , of course , by congratulating Mr Langen , our rapporteur , on his work , as well as all the members of the committee and of the Conciliation Committee .
we would also like to stress that the main objective is the promotion of strategies for sustainable development , whose positive effects would extend to a broader geographical area than the local community itself , and we therefore feel it is appropriate for the projects to be integrated into the development programmes , included in Objectives 1 and 2 , and into the regional planning of the regions and countries in which they are located .
in order to complete the programme and be able to present it , we first need to complete our consultations with Parliament , the social partners and non-governmental organisations .
I think we must do what we can to see that all Members can receive their own national channel .
they are already having implications for resource availability .
curiously , very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets , even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General , and this is clearly something which should not happen .
the Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market .
only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored .
all that remains for me to say is : time to get down to business .
this is why it is essential , as a matter of urgency , for the European Union to undertake a radical review of its directives on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners of the cargoes .
it was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid .
the Union &apos; s borders must no longer be an obstacle to balanced development , but - on the contrary - an opportunity , a bridge to more fruitful cooperation .
and , when I say that the Commission took that view , I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler , who is from Austria ; and who , once again , demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a Member of the European Commission , under oath , in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning .
what is happening in France , Mr President , appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties .
Mr President , the common position is sound , but it is up to Parliament to improve the common position on end-of-life vehicles .
as we see it , there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future : a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller , concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service - also known as the audit service - which has yet to be set up , and finally , there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularities by OLAF , the new anti-fraud office .
however , Madam President , these considerations must not hide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow , and which the Socialists will vote in favour of , will put in place one of the European Union &apos; s most important programmes .
we know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties .
the first report was widely publicised , formally debated and used - just like the controversy and news leaks which preceded it - to make mincemeat , first of the President of the Commission , and then of the majority of the European Commissioners , even though they had no connection with fraud , mismanagement or nepotism .
I know that you , as Members of Parliament , in your own regions and countries , are all going to work together with the programme participants so that all these small flowers , as one Member of Parliament said , go to make a vast multicoloured carpet .
this is a silent revolution and in this respect I expected more from your communication .
the German Government &apos; s intervention to save the Holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy .
the refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget ; the motion of censure tabled in this House a year ago for differing reasons ; and the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the reform of the Commission which led to the mass resignation of the Commission itself , are now part of European folklore .
our opinion is that it is vital to contribute to setting up an administration in Kosovo and that it is by no means absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employees in this region .
the fate of the Commission , of the whole European Union , rests on delivery of this reform .
( applause )
which Commissioners are members of this group ?
it is desirable for Member States to have a certain amount of freedom to determine the number of projects themselves within the confines of a certain budget .
I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity , not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions .
the Member States would not accept a regulatory agency , so there is not very much point in your proposing one .
for Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity , we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged .
we are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution , but against the granting of discharge .
we can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision .
I would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von Wogau report into four groups . I do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the Commission , but , on the contrary , fundamental contributions , since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome .
Mr President , Commissioner , regarding the relationship between science , on the one hand , and applying the precautionary principle on the other , the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence .
Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a report , which , on reading it , gives the impression of simply confirming and accepting the Council &apos; s draft decision .
we might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator .
Mr President , Commissioner , I think we need this directive .
having said this , the EU &apos; s responsibility , which is both yours and ours , is to try and move beyond the provisional nature of Resolution 1244 and devise a future scenario for the whole region .
assessment and publication are part of this , and it has of course assumed responsibility for these in the past .
it raises expectations , but it can also lead to disappointment .
the Atlantic West Coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react , for their capitulation to the multinationals .
I merely mention it as an example of where we must take care and where I would recommend that we try to achieve more legal security in the future .
some have said it is not right for us to interfere in Austrian politics .
coming from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry , I can tell you that it is not possible , retroactively , to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road , i.e. effectively making them bear the costs arising from 80 % of the total number of cars in Europe .
through his management , Commissioner Monti achieves good results , as did his predecessor and , clearly , he has established a guarantee which , in parallel with the creation and development of the European internal market , has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the market economy within the Union may work adequately , without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market is enlarged , as has happened in the European Union since 1993 .
in itself , globalisation is positive .
Madam President , Commissioner , rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen , somehow or other , today &apos; s agenda has come full circle .
this could be of a maximum of 15 years of age .
that is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text , not to take anything away from the proposal , but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide .
if the European Community had done the same , a great disaster would have been avoided .
in any case , we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action .
this report , therefore , appears at a crucial time , on the eve of Mr Kinnock &apos; s reforms .
we must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the European Union ; we must contribute to building infrastructural links that will end its centuries-old isolation ; we must intensify efforts to build a democratic , pluralist society in these countries with institutions , public structures , police forces and a structured civil society , but , above all , we must press these countries to work together in the context of a united region , as regards both politics and the economy .
to conclude , the next five years will be crucial .
they have also shown how they feel : not all the demonstrations have taken place outside Austria .
finally , if the Commission and the relevant Councils of Ministers permit , I should like to stress that the Members of the European Parliament should be given more information on the procedures relating to the implementation of the INTERREG projects and , beyond that , of similar initiatives .
please therefore accept what I am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate , and I believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer .
but , ladies and gentlemen , if we do remove every reference and any recourse to a TAO at a later date then this will have a consequence and that will be an increase in the number of officials &apos; jobs needed to do this work , because somebody will have to do it and I cannot keep redeploying the same staff indefinitely , at a time when our duties are increasing with the pre-accession structural instrument ( ISPA ) and in order to ensure that , the Community appropriations for which I am responsible , often in partnership or on terms of coresponsibility with Member States , are monitored better , with discipline and transparency .
it is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens , where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves .
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe .
some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominees - to be members of the board .
just consider the facts : we looked at Austria a while ago , but we can also look at the stock markets , Mr President : given that the euro , that great undertaking , has fallen 16 % against the dollar in a year , then perhaps , I will not say a government , but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of Commissioners or similar issues .
explanations OF VOTE- Own resources
we made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement , as did the President this afternoon , to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday .
we thank Mr Seixas da Costa , but he can also write his letter to the three kings .
before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months .
we all agree on this .
the European Commission &apos; s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions .
there is little room for negotiation if one of the parties states beforehand : anything is open for discussion , as long as the budget stays fixed .
the Euro , employment , even security , are not enough .
then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution .
nevertheless , the storms that took place in the last week of December showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us .
the aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging .
thank you , Mrs Fraga Estévez .
I would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stocks overall , over the whole Community fishing area .
for example , Mr Kreissl-Dörfler spoke in English about &apos; long-term capital for long-term projects &apos; - this is an obvious issue .
in the future , we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place .
these worthwhile amendments are the outcome of this ; I think that we will be able to arrive at a solution to the problem , that is , to reconcile environmental requirements with market and labour requirements .
I should like the vote on the Community EQUAL initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point .
we await the White Paper on the governance of the European Union dealing with the issue of balance between Member States &apos; governments and the European Union institutions which is to be published this summer .
without these prospects that we have outlined , Europe would , once again , have no future .
on the other hand , prevention is essential .
for example , we are currently looking into TAOs . this is a key point but , at the same time , we want to abolish temporary staff at the Commission .
my second point is that we need a properly resourced Commission .
as far as possible , we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset , instead of having to be tackled separately and later .
my final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the European Community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations .
this has been the year in which policies on justice and home affairs have been provided with a Community framework .
amended again as such by the Schroedter report , they are a step in the right direction .
if the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the CEN and the Economic Commission are at ?
the tax would be targeted at the right place : at the speculators .
we can only condemn a policy on minorities which is inevitably dangerous for social cohesion .
how can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations , and indeed many others who , in order to make more profit , take the risk of making the world uninhabitable ?
it will be adopted through a legally-binding Commission decision to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities .
Mr President , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur , not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made .
there is no question of it allowing xenophobic , racist and anti-Semitic ministers to be tolerated at within it .
ultimately , the polluter must pay .
if competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy , real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream .
the competition policy has , as far as these resources permitted , contributed to this event .
it is also true , however , that , since the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements , 39 % of the territory of the West Bank has been handed over to the Palestinian National Authority , together with two thirds of the Gaza Strip and , more importantly , this agreement has so far been scrupulously complied with , since , under the terms laid down in Sharm el-Sheikh , the Israeli Government has the right to delay that handover .
unfortunately , it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality .
the citizens are right to ask : &quot; do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever ? &quot;
I consider , however , that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and , unfortunately , this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches .
the reform is important but , if it aggravates the situation , reduces or weakens the supranational powers of the Commission , then the structure of European integration , as planned by the founding fathers for the European Commission , will be at risk .
a single key is to suffice in future .
this was , after all , one of the causes of the downfall of the last Commission .
from the point of view of the Commission , in this interinstitutional game , I believe that this is important and I am very happy to highlight it .
the Community contribution of over EUR 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpinned the Palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza .
through cooperation , small , independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains .
too much money is wasted on propaganda and investigation bureaux , consultation and control , and a great deal of money ends up back in the country where it was collected in the first place .
today , the Commission is obliged , on a case-by-case basis , to weigh considerations of confidentiality against people &apos; s demands for , and expectation of , transparency and , if the Commission &apos; s regulation is adopted , the Commission will be entitled to lock away whole categories of documents without having to give them specific consideration .
we would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with conscientious objections can more easily object to tasks which are unethical or unlawful .
the next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading ( A5-0006 / 2000 ) , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of the European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles &#91; 8095 / 1 / 1999 - C5-0180 / 1999 - 1997 / 0194 ( COD ) &#93; ( Rapporteur : Mr Florenz )
the issue which we should all raise , and I did so myself , in a diplomatic way , a while ago , concerns the very substance of Security Council Resolution 12 / 99 .
so with those remarks I would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success .
since the Council recognises the fact that culture is a major economic asset , it should , in my view , demonstrate this in practice .
I would also ask the Commission to ensure that the environmental pillar of the EU &apos; s policy is integrated into the projects submitted and that the goal of reducing CO2 for example forms an experimental added value in the projects proposed .
here , projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support ; they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries .
we need to deploy the energies of the unemployed , the underused skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems .
the social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue .
all these complex problems undermine the quality of life for our urban residents , yet we have the potential in these areas to create growth and prosperity .
this is a big task but it can be done .
I believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the Commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
I want to say to Mr Poos that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to restructure their economies and , to that extent , are helping to undermine the value of the euro .
I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so furiously , and at the same time , from my position here in this Chamber , point to how important it is to support these regions and people .
this is particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the funds deployed .
that is what we are lacking , Commissioner : the political will to make a start in tackling speculation .
above all , Madam President - and here I will end - we must be able to express this in plain language , clearly , by changing to some extent the jargon which we use , because we cannot ask the Europeans , who are living through profound changes , to take part and show enthusiasm towards us if we continue to use a form of language which they find completely inaccessible .
this is a scenario whereby the European Union has a membership of over 25 Member States .
you know that you will always have our support here in Parliament , and that includes your proposal , and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it .
what point is there in issuing restrictive directives if , once they are at sea , most vessels do just what they wish ?
therefore , in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , and , of course , as an MEP , I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission .
no , there must be no undermining of OLAF &apos; s authority , and neither do I think this was the rapporteur &apos; s intention .
you have mentioned Ethiopia , which falls within the scope of national indicative programmes , but there are , as you know , several Community actions to combat AIDS , and in this respect , you are right , and the United States will probably not do any better .
the first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy .
this proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state .
finally , but no less importantly , I would like to refer to the rapporteur &apos; s proposal that , in future , this type of report should also include , amongst other issues , an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State .
if you ratify this development , then you are ratifying the development of the Union into a body which violates the sovereignty and the freedom of the Member States , and we should then have no option but to withdraw from such a Union .
in this way , positive development of the regions is also possible , because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance .
turning now to some of the individual questions raised here today , I can also confirm that we wish to have the widest possible partnership and participation in LEADER + .
they have now got to grips with &quot; EU &quot; .
I believe that it is important for the Community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to receive overwhelming support so that the Commission is also obliged to take into consideration the constructive proposals made by the European Parliament , because Parliament put the appropriations for EQUAL in the reserve precisely so as to ensure that Members &apos; ideas were also reflected in this Community initiative .
but how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led ?
society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business .
these should indeed be excluded from the directive . secondly , the controversial question as to who bears the responsibility for taking back cars .
I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States .
no transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
we estimate that the Commission &apos; s new social action programme for the next five years will be ready at the end of this summer .
we therefore welcome increased resources for OLAF so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently .
however , I could also regard them as a customer , and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field , that is evolved structures , stifle competition .
I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner , but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless .
we feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion .
this is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union &apos; s institutional bodies .
Mr President , Commissioner Patten has our understanding .
in short , the issue is an important one .
Mr President , on behalf of the PSE Group , I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme .
Mr Alavanos , I cannot agree with what you just said in your last sentence on Mr Kouchner &apos; s responsibilities , and I would like to make two very important points here . the structure being implemented in Kosovo is under the auspices of the United Nations .
Mr Prodi said he would act anyway , that he preferred to get things right , but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting .
think of last year &apos; s deadly criticism of the Commission &apos; s lack of propriety , ethics and accountability .
the fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure , that it did not establish time limits , that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files , or that the right to defence was not properly recognised , were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform .
but , as Mr Lange so rightly said , this solution is totally unfair to European car manufacturers .
this is an issue which , as you will understand , will have to be addressed at IGC level and is an issue that only a Special European Council can authorise the Portuguese Presidency to pursue , because this kind of issue falls outside the institutional framework in which the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will take place .
the von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level .
we therefore have a number of amendments .
that situation will be compounded by social reclassifications resulting from European Union enlargement , and we must therefore make provision for the economic regeneration and social cohesion of our cities .
on the other hand , we can go a long way using the existing tools .
that is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 Member States yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner .
however , my question for a very long time has been this : what happened with previous policies ?
if there is to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangements , that change should be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process .
an individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection , not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months thereafter .
( sustained applause )
it is not just that we should pillory state aid ; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objectives .
only a strengthened Europe is immune to political opportunists who exploit dissatisfaction .
the Commission would like to stress in particular that , in the drafting of the code , it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the European Ombudsman .
the European Parliament and its Committee on Constitutional Affairs ought instead to have been more specific and concentrated on just a few points in addition to the Council decision in Helsinki , so stating what it considered to be the most pressing matters for discussion , including the question of establishing a public prosecutor to deal with crimes against the institutions of the European Union and their financial interests .
therefore , Madam President , I believe that it is our right and our obligation to ask the Austrians to reconsider and reflect , because this type of menace , which we have suffered before in Europe , may not only harm Austria , but it may also spread , and I say this bearing history in mind .
the procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 1762 .
the report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform .
we have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other , that of finding the easiest possible solution .
the most important task of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States .
this is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes .
that is a reduction of 3 ¾ % compared with the previous CIs .
my other question concerns Africa , which is the only continent not mentioned in &apos; Shaping the New Europe &apos; .
what we find most shocking is the fact that this joint intervention claims the authority of the Treaty , as if this stated somewhere that henceforth the free and democratic expression of a people could be cancelled by the will of the heads of government of neighbouring countries who in fact , in this instance , have carefully refrained from consulting their own peoples .
I can vouch that I have already received significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster , a significant portion of which falls within Ireland &apos; s only Objective I region .
I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency .
perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning .
adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
however , it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on .
the Commission must therefore be the guarantor of the strategic framework for promoting ability to work and quality of work , of the assessment of results and of the effective communication of best practices .
the document mentions common values on different occasions .
approximately ten per cent of lead production is to be found in cars , but also cadmium , chromium , mercury and other very dangerous substances .
I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this .
the Agenda 2000 issues are , of course , ones that relate to your third and fourth strategic objectives , the economic and social Agenda and a better quality of life .
we will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session .
the fact is there are too few women involved in research work in the European Union .
we shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues .
in this light , the events we are seeing in Austria must be seen as tragic .
it is fostered by a fair appraisal of our assets .
perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise .
we have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union .
given that the Commission is represented by Vice-President de Palacio , I believe that , before voting , it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme , as agreed . alternatively , Parliament is not ready to examine this programme , as some appear to be suggesting .
the emphasis is on local groups in which the authorities , non-profit-making organisations and profit-making companies join forces .
the Council has not yet discussed the possibility of introducing a tax on movements of capital as Professor Tobin suggested .
the time is now right , I think , to consider including the exchange of positive development experience in the scope of transnational cooperation .
it merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines , deletes provisions which are no longer applicable , and lays down the procedures for a ) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b ) enacting less stringent national regulations , in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas .
whatever system is adopted , ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer .
they were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair , surrounded by a horde of state security police .
on the face of it these two proposals appear to be implementing certain procedural changes to facilitate freedom of movement across Europe and to give effect to the recent court cases Mrs Berger referred to in her opening remarks .
this is why it is important to prevent waste materials .
three reasons and they are as follows : on account of the economic importance of third-country workers in the EU , in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market .
they will instead help industry to be in the vanguard of eventually producing environmentally friendly and more fuel-efficient cars .
does that give me hope for the year 2000 ?
in line with the usual procedure , it is the European Committee for Standardisation ( CEN ) which puts forward standards in this area , and they are then integrated in to the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road signed in Geneva in 1957 ( known generally as ADR ) , applicable throughout Europe , whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the EU .
the Council has always stressed the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrated such acts and of those who continue to perpetrate such acts .
finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused .
according to the report issued by the Court of Auditors on the year 1998 , this is not an imagined risk .
it also means that our Parliament President and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and , therefore , not only within the working party , but also at the same political level as the Commission .
yet , through LEADER , there can be no doubting its effectiveness as an integral part of broader EU and national policy .
consequently , we have to build schools , hospitals , and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over .
I believe we can learn something from this .
firstly , because it clearly stipulates the environmental objectives .
we revealed the hollowness of the republicans who were nationalistic , xenophobic and anti-minority .
the key idea involves making qualified majority voting the general rule while modifying the content of this qualified majority to make it a double simple majority , of States and peoples , in order to increase the Commission &apos; s room for manoeuvre and reduce that of the minority States .
it has once again been demonstrated that conciliation is incompatible with the demand for unanimity in the Council .
in our Group , we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996 .
any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port , regardless of all the port charges .
so far , efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success .
we are solidly with our Austrian friends who have proven to be good Europeans in the past .
Madam President , although some of the aims of the Tobin tax are fairly worthy of support , introducing the tax exclusively within the territory of the European Union , as the first area of the world to do so , would sound the death knell for the European currency markets .
we need a public debate on this .
Jörg Haider &apos; s rise to power , with the inauguration of a conservative right-wing and FPÖ coalition government , is a sign of the terrible revival in Europe of a monster to which liberalism has given birth .
in view of this concentration on a limited number of projects , the publication and dissemination of the results of the new URBAN Community Initiative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a multiplier effect .
yet the whole of the Commission communication is based on the opposite theory . in this theory , on the pretext of ensuring the best protection for peoples , their margin of independent choice should be increasingly limited by new regulations , new policies or new , restrictive legal structures such as the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out , once and for all , the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion , particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference .
I believe that this will be difficult but , in any event , we should carry out a review of the registers of the European Union countries .
if we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned , in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year .
it is true , I admit it , and you are well aware of the reasons , ladies and gentlemen .
allow me to remind you , however , that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban .
I am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get mileage out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas chambers of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda , as , for example , the Italian MEP Bertinotti did yesterday on Italian TV when he accused Mr Haider of denying the holocaust .
consequently , we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars .
we are aware that in this age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers - in 1998 USD 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with take-overs - restrictive practices are being held in check , not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the USA or Japan , or others , until we get the international competition law we so badly need .
in my opinion , funding for cross-border initiatives should only be provided if it is actually required by the regions .
in that context I support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection .
this situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly .
first of all , we must shed some light on this shipwreck .
it cannot afford to remain outside the regional alliances being forged in this area , lest it miss out on a historic opportunity , and the same applies to our regions in the Caribbean .
incomprehensibly , trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition , and I would not be surprised if union members were already members of OLAF , thereby placing this institution which should , at least formally , guarantee its impartiality , at great risk .
we want an area of freedom , security and justice for the citizens of Europe , not against them .
Mr Berenguer made a very accurate analysis , justifying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition , but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the Member States , are truly identical in all regions .
Mr President , as far as the second reading is concerned , the Commission can only accept one proposed amendment put forward by Parliament .
computer-controlled selling programmes turned a random blip into an avalanche , burying jobs , lives and industries across the globe .
we must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea-worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels .
I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament .
in relation to Mrs Lynne &apos;s question on interim payments : that is a matter that might very well be addressed by Parliament as it relates to budget issues .
but here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer .
of course this is also the basic idea .
Mr Prodi , you do not know what you are talking about .
Honourable Member , I should just like to stress that both Denmark and numerous other Member States are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law .
the Rules of Procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that is exactly why this back burner is extremely useful .
we have asked for a Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office and criminal law , but we also need administrative law for the EU .
as you can see we have many exhibitions around Parliament , whether they be about different countries or whatever .
is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal ?
what measures does the Council intend to adopt , and when , with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stocks , the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability ?
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust .
which national fund will pay for my end-of-life vehicle ?
Mr Jonckheer , Mrs Thyssen and Mr Gemelli raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of State aid .
the recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East .
Mr President , Commissioner , competition is exactly what we need .
they should be accessible to smaller groups , accessible for them to be able to devise , implement and monitor the programmes .
it is true , there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way .
so it is somewhat upsetting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper .
the evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem .
I concur with what other members of my political group have said and I commend the tone of your document . however , there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work .
this situation can be achieved over a period of time .
if a company in France says that it has an employee who has to work in Denmark on a permanent basis , and only in Denmark , then it certainly ought only to be possible to apply for this card for Denmark .
my Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible .
we all know that !
the Commission will then adopt the code at second reading .
we must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in Brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not .
this led to strikes and smear campaigns by intransigent trade unions , whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wishy-washy compromise .
European taxpayers need to be re-assured .
question No 42 by ( H-0817 / 99 ) :
now , however , he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing .
under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation , third country nationals wishing to move to the UK under the procedures described , will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another Member State , thereby by-passing UK border controls .
therefore - in summary - I await , and many of us await , your report , Commissioner Kinnock , so that we can really express our opinion on it , which is the duty of this Parliament .
are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer , and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect ?
we must increase our efficiency in this area . we must reopen the Danube to boats .
nevertheless , we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to .
it is very important for this ALTENER programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it .
it should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the European Union .
in this House , in the past , large-scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the Commission , under its power of initiative , launched , not as experiments , but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress , but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the European Union .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission &apos; s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87 , 88 and 89 of the Treaties .
a compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers .
secondly , we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes , and the White Paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation .
regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States .
I must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason , be it the reason which you mentioned , sexual orientation , ethnic discrimination or any other reason .
the report was a major undertaking because it also incorporates opinions from four further committees - from the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities , and the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs .
the Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law .
the Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts .
( FR ) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers .
as with all other Community initiatives , this is very positive .
as this is the first Valentine &apos; s Day of the new millennium I hope that you will agree with me that it would be fitting for this House to mark this day by making a firm commitment to tackling heart disease , the biggest killer in the European Union .
further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men .
may I , to finish off , thank Mrs Berger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having , in that way , added an important degree of meaning to her report ?
we must make a rapid , strong and united response .
Mr President , may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear , adequate and , at the same time , very firm response .
a communication in June will set out the full proposal for change .
as for us in Parliament , I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which was signed in May .
we feel it is extremely important for the European Union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid .
I would ask that they reconsider , since this is not the case .
we would have preferred to have had greater clarification of the agenda and more guarantees on the method before giving our opinion , and frankly , we did not appreciate the discourtesy the Portuguese Presidency showed towards the European Parliament by scheduling the start of the Intergovernmental Conference for Saint Valentine &apos; s day , the first day of the Strasbourg part-session .
from the sixth periodic report on the regions , one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect .
Madam President , I want to start by reinforcing the caution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in addressing this five-year plan .
as an Austrian , I still have a vivid memory , as , I believe , we all do , of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel , where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense .
( Parliament rejected the request , with 164 votes for , 166 votes against and 7 abstentions )
in assessing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge , the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned , in this case in the course of 1997 .
as the final text rightly states , actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities .
if , among other things , as the programme of the Portuguese Presidency stresses as well , the Commission could promote a new phase of social dialogue , focusing on an agreed strategy of socialisation and diffusion of knowledge , in other words , a strategy for employability and the definition of its rules , this would allow us to take a step towards having employees participate in the informed and consensual management of the restructuring and reemployment processes .
Mr President , I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report .
- ( FR ) The vote which has just taken place in this Chamber is a historic one for it is the first time we have ever debated the internal political situation of one of our Member States with such anxiety .
first of all : who should pay ?
there is , as yet , no European Court case law on Efterløn , but it could validly be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality .
measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is , we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut .
competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union .
many people in my country say they see British culture being under threat , for example , from Portugal , from Germany , from Finland , for heaven &apos; s sake .
including Jörg Haider &apos; s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in Europe , and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other Union Member States or in candidate countries .
do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration ?
there are amendments which propose splitting the costs fifty-fifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car .
there are those who are in favour of new agreements between Israel and Syria , but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the Middle East issue .
there is a Paris Memorandum in existence , let me remind you , which stipulates a minimum for inspection , that is , one in four of the vessels putting into European ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned .
it lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us .
one last word regarding the programme . I think it very important for renewable energies to be firmly established in the regions so that they can develop in the long term and so that they can contribute to the economy and to job creation there .
it has thereby succeeded in closing two serious loopholes in the internal market which are of great significance to the European economy and to 5 million third-country nationals in the European Union who are here as workers or on a self-employed basis .
our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy , a pillar of the social market economy and of European construction .
this will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the Palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law .
finally , this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity .
why has there been no fire drill , either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings ?
in my own country , mythology tells of the teeming hordes of faceless Brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of European judges .
finally , even if the Tobin tax is designed to curb speculations with currencies , there is still the risk that even non-speculative streams would be affected , and that is not the intention .
in that event we would not have moved forward , but rather backwards , in the application of competition policy in the Union .
these are difficult subjects , subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain .
we regret this as there was actually money left over from the Structural Funds in some countries which could really have helped with pilot projects . we should remember that it is these URBAN projects which specifically allow a truly urban policy to be established .
that is naturally unacceptable .
the second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement .
an urgent request has been referred to us , and we approve it .
does the Council consider that , on the basis of Article 255 of the Treaty , national legislation on transparency can be regulated , that is to say legislation not relating to the EU &apos; s institutions ?
I should like to raise three points which for us , as Members of the PPE Group , must be focal points when such an area is created .
I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament &apos; s position .
Mr Rübig , as I said , I understand your concerns very well .
consequently , the Commission has asked for the advice of a group of experts regarding the entirety of the reforms which could be implemented in order to enable the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance to maintain the quality and coherence of their administration of justice in forthcoming decades .
Mr President , one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is , to my mind , the rapporteur &apos; s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration .
the Austrian People &apos; s Party , which I represent here in this Parliament , used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the EU and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the European Union , and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement .
what are the values of the Belgian Socialist Party , which only goes from paedophilia scandals to corruption scandals , via Vandam and Agusta ?
in the first place , if administrative procedures are not simplified , it will be hard to attain Community objectives on reform , with a view to greater efficiency and concentration .
we are ready for it , whether it is a matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , on which work has started , the CFSP and the consequences for the institutions of the current defence policy negotiations , or an extremely difficult subject on which we are continuing to work : reorganisation of the Treaties .
Mr President , public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion .
he will join us and speak as soon as he arrives .
most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers .
that is something for which I have a deep appreciation .
the next item is the report ( A5-0011 / 2000 ) by Mr Langen , on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener ( C5-0333 / 1999 - 1997 / 0370 ( COD ) )
we must therefore congratulate the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , on having the wisdom , in order to make things perfectly clear , to reintroduce the clause making an exception of the vintage cars which are part of our industrial and cultural heritage .
the report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the Member States .
rather than go back over the areas that have already been covered I would like to deal with one specific topic : the question of drugs and how we tackle the pervasiveness of the drug culture in our societies .
it is of decisive importance to get local business , organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes .
it is not the Portuguese Presidency &apos; s job to hand out the presents that everyone wants , especially those that the European Parliament is asking for .
that is why I voted in favour of the amendments .
one thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recycled plastic bumpers of cars .
in other words , it is positive discrimination .
this is an approach , Mr President , which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation .
but at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful .
are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved ?
however , despite the fact that the volume is relatively small , it is nevertheless symbolically important that there is a common desire throughout the Community as a whole to support this type of action , which contributes to our genuine compliance with the Kyoto commitments . this action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources , greater safety in our energy supplies and , in the case of SAVE , to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy , thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set .
in fact , renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives .
should we at long last be drafting convergence criteria , in which - as you in fact hint at in this programme - the aim would be that unemployment in no Member State should be higher than , say , the three most successful countries in this matter ?
the aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth , not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy .
it worked for us .
we must govern Europe in such a way as to make us more efficient , to bring us closer to the citizens and to encourage everyone to get involved , starting with the important issue of the involvement of women .
I can also say , in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment - which , as you know , I share - that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental State aid .
the Council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost , not all of it as Mr Bowis has mistakenly said .
we do not consider that Amendments Nos 2 and 14 add anything to the directive .
I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress .
in short , Commissioner , I would therefore like to know whether in this case , the precautionary principle as you understand it , would in any case , require the product to be taken off the market , until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary .
the West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today ?
almost three weeks after the disaster , several thousand people were still without electricity and telephones , 500 000 hectares of forestry land , or 100 million cubic metres of forest , have been ruined , and our historical heritage has also been affected , as the sad example of the park at the Palace of Versailles demonstrates .
these are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Martinez on 11 January 2000 .
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner , who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate , to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings .
in this regard , the current process of negotiations on Malta &apos; s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag .
by entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business , but creating will .
this text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the European Central Bank . this is untenable .
since 1996 , Parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties .
in the fifth place , we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the European Union , and incidentally , that includes the candidate countries .
the Minutes of 3 February were originally distributed in Brussels so perhaps this is why some Members did not receive them .
like the rapporteur , we deplore the fact that it has been excluded from strand IIIA .
in this regard , we are certainly on the right track , but as some Members have already stressed , the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers &apos; responsibility will become a shared responsibility .
I would urge both the Member States and the Commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in Europe .
he has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change .
I have repeatedly emphasised that , indeed not just as a Commissioner , but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning .
obviously , the cohesion policy exists for less-favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Funds , the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund exist for the cohesion policy .
the basic objectives of an EU-wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employability , entrepreneurship and adaptability .
there does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme .
my colleagues , Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken , somewhat sceptically , about some aspects of the matter in hand .
from the point of view of economic growth , and therefore of increasing employment and wealth , safeguarding a competition policy in the Member States is becoming a crucial factor , and one that is certainly very important for our future .
no , according to the Christian Democrats in Amendment No. 38 : car manufacturers and car drivers should split the cost 50 / 50 .
we should be aware , for example , that Shell and British Petroleum refused to use the Erika to transport their oil .
Madam President , this matter is far too serious to be dealt with by means of an urgent procedure at this time .
Mr President , our group welcomes the horizontal thrust of the EQUAL initiative so that , if you are a British Muslim physically disabled in some way you no longer have to chose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group : you can use your expertise and experience to solve problems , rather than being defined as the problem .
Mr Prodi secured positive comments for a proposal which would otherwise have been met with criticism , for the new draft regulation presents as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to documents in the Commission &apos; s possession . there follows , however , a long , long list of exceptions , and there is legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exceptions .
the first is that this matter is sub judice in several European countries , and I would like to remind Members that there is still no European judicial area nor a European legal system .
it makes it impossible for those same Member States , at the IGC , to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights .
relating to Wednesday :
the EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people .
clearly , they have no role to play in your strategy .
if peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable , non-fossil energy source , it must form its own class , especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned .
so our Treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late , but we are not at that point : today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point .
I have also noted , to my great satisfaction , that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty , or the eurosceptic groups are calling for Europe to regulate , and I think that this is in fact the right level to take action .
however , forgive me if I am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me .
Mrs Stenzel &apos; s report has , however , turned out very well , at least where the prescribed guidelines are concerned .
the same is true with regard to immigration policy .
is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying , in legal terms , the creation of a specifically Community-wide criminal law which , although it might be called subsidiary , will always clash with the practice , and in certain areas , with the traditional , separate criminal law of the Member States ?
there is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio &apos; s reports .
transport of dangerous goods by road
Mr President , I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan greeting , which betokens peace and happiness .
is there a Member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?
I object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for Question Time ; it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda .
as an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power . a sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today .
I would therefore ask Members to examine my amendment carefully , and I hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result .
Altener
this human diversity is our main sources of wealth , and this is the reason why it is my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it , wherever it may exist .
I have three short questions , the first being as follows .
the beginning of the talks with Syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in Moscow at the end of the month .
illegal state aid , by contrast , destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment .
we considered that increasing public confidence by combating everyday urban crime was one of the central tasks of urban regeneration .
however , we must remember that , in addition to URBAN , a number of other Community instruments are also available in the social sector : innovative actions under Article 6 of the ESF regulation , pilot projects , particularly the new preparatory action for local commitment to employment that has just been introduced by the European Parliament under the 2000 budget and the EQUAL and INTERREG initiatives and mainstream ESF activities .
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity . this programme must work at full capacity .
that should be the starting point for our efforts .
you reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it .
enlargement of the Union is just a few years away .
they are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection .
that figure of EUR 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the European Union !
Madam President , many of the speakers from the Socialist Group have already identified key areas where there are gaps in the Commission &apos; s statement .
I have one last point to make , which is about the European Union &apos; s responsibility and , specifically , in this case , about possible action by the Council in this matter , and the responsibility of the international community , which has overall responsibility for the situation in Kosovo .
would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes .
the processing cost can then be incorporated in the price of new cars .
this , I thought , is no longer permissible , certainly not at the moment .
we Socialists desperately want a European pact for growth and employment .
secondly , I also share the Commissioner &apos; s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path .
the next item is the report ( A5-0018 / 2000 ) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference &#91; 14094 / 1999 - C5-0341 / 1999 - 1999 / 0825 ( CNS ) &#93; .
for us this is straightforward : in the case of new vehicles it should be the manufacturer since this will also compel manufacturers to design and build recyclable cars .
having said all that , I must say that unfortunately , my group will not be voting for your report as a united front .
obstinate as I am , I also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circulating on the Internet . otherwise , we shall not get anywhere in this fight .
I am therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry workers are also prepared .....
we do not agree with this type of tax because its application , in the event that it could happen , would not achieve the aims which Mr Tobin presented at the time and which the Left in this House wishes to revive .
the negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions &apos; GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment .
please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he is on European affairs .
nobody is asking for an IGC of the Maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated .
I shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur , one positive and one negative .
the foodstuffs legislation in the European Union is the most ambitious in the world .
we must argue for equality of the sexes , the famous &apos; gender mainstreaming &apos; , which is one of the least developed questions in the Prodi Commission &apos; s programme .
I would , therefore , ask the Commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups .
that being the case , since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources , it will certainly be have a key role .
today , as previously in the history of Europe , right-wing extremism is the result of insecure social and economic conditions of life .
we must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference .
it must also cooperate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of data in good time , which is to say in time for the ninth report .
recourse to the precautionary principle
it is to take new ideas and try them out in LEADER , with the participants on the ground , with the local organisations on the ground , with many non-governmental organisations , with the churches , with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities .
there is one final issue I would like to raise .
the Commission also agrees with a provision for cases in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer is terminated at short notice .
for our part , we shall be attempting to strengthen and consolidate the European position on cultural goods and services and on activities in this sphere , because we believe that this is an identifying feature which is crucial to the Union &apos; s image and to the Union &apos; s own particular identity .
you have shown us the way , Mr Monti , with the single market scoreboard .
do you think that , when we legislate about chemicals , we should say that we are ignoring those chemicals which are already on the market and that we are legislating only for what is to be produced in the future ?
there is agreement on the principle that marginalisation , discrimination and inequalities on the labour market should be reduced .
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur .
I should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observatory is nothing new .
I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need .
when we suddenly refused this offer , an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day .
you have not integrated it anywhere .
how often has a lawyer with two companies and one project , in the face of a Commission guideline given ex ante , changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules !
will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistants is adopted as soon as possible ?
on the contrary , since it is certain that not all countries would accept it , we would open the way to speculation and fraud and that really would create volatility , instability , insecurity , opacity and unfair competition in the field of financial services operating on an international level .
the next item is the report ( A5-0004 / 2000 ) by Mrs van der Laan , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities for the 1997 financial year ( Section I - Parliament , II - Council , III - Commission , IV - Court of Justice and V - Court of Auditors ) &#91; SEC ( 1998 ) 520 - C4-0350 / 1998 , SEC ( 1998 ) 522 - C4-0351 / 1998 , SEC ( 1998 ) 519 - C4-0352 / 1999 &#93;
next , I would like to thank the emergency services and the armed forces of the Union &apos; s Member States who , in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation , came to support the efforts of their French colleagues .
we know , for example , that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity , so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one , two or five years , but over many more .
we are aware that it is a delicate debate .
we should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees .
it must be rid of some of its more outdated elements ; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why European civil servants should be paid an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open borders , or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of Member States .
we have done a lot in the Balkans : the new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo , the Balkans Task Force and new regulations to speed up procedures .
I find this a well-balanced formula which does not preclude a number of other things .
again , this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity .
the fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power , the development of closer relations with liberalism in the countries of Eastern Europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of Europe , particularly by increasing military budgets .
we cannot , and we do not , support in any way the sentiments and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his references to the Third Reich .
as far as the Commission is concerned , it is willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload , but we cannot give up the practice of checking the relevance and quality of the proposed programmes , indeed you would be the first to criticise us if we did .
I would ask you to support this common position .
Madam President , I thought I had three minutes .
within a few hours of the presentation of the report President Santer announced the resignation of his entire team .
we must thank those who , while defenceless and lacking in resources , have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions , the marine ecosystem and European fishing stocks .
basically , we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but , since the vote only concerns how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used , we have confined ourselves to assessing the contents and think , in general , that the proposal for regenerating neighbourhoods in crisis contains some sensible observations , as well as some good suggestions and criteria for the relevant projects .
I shall point out that a directive on the approximation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 January 1997 .
we are pleased about this and we congratulate the Council on these decisions , despite the fact that , for this House , the Treaty of Amsterdam included one disappointment : that of delaying , for five years , our role , our ability to participate actively , to democratically control this area of freedom , security and justice , as well as the role taken in it by the Court of Justice .
what is the idea behind preventing people from working when they wish to do so ?
this is a smear on the voters in my neighbouring country which I cannot condone .
it is not by chance that the Committee on Culture &apos; s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure , for one or other Member State in the Council always holds culture hostage to other interests .
Mrs Jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation .
the Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation
Madam President , although I too have spent most of my life in fast cars , I agree with my colleague , Mr Florenz , that the directive on scrapping cars must make it clear that vintage cars are not included .
I want to thank the Commission for what I perceive as a very positive answer .
I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century .
Parliament , therefore , can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put URBAN back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U-turn .
and , on this subject , Commissioner , you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats .
competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story ; take the energy and telecommunications sectors , where there has been a demonstrable lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service .
Madam President , an omission appears to have been made . in the list of tabled motions for a resolution which you have just read out , no mention is made of the compromise motion tabled jointly by the PSE , ELDR , GUE / NGL and Greens / EFA Groups and by Mrs Kuntz and Mr Coûteaux .
I would like to draw people &apos;s attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
Madam President , we are not asking for more bureaucracy , as Mr Karas put it just a few minutes ago .
it is also distressing to think that the initiative taken against Austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that , in any case , the European Union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act , and to prevent and rectify the course of events .
I also believe that the Commission , or President Prodi , has acted as a guardian of the Treaties .
it has led to a growth in mergers , acquisitions and company restructuring and to gigantic sums being raised with increasing frequency on the financial markets .
the question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness , the Dalai Lama &apos; s , proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair ?
what I learned is that , actually , there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision .
undoubtedly , reform of the European Council is also going to be included in this White Paper on the governance of the European Union which will be published this summer .
if you decide to add this debate to the agenda , it will be introduced by speeches from Mr Seixas da Costa , President-in-Office of the Council , and Mr Romano Prodi , President of the Commission .
how could you completely ignore a common - I repeat ; common - policy with such an economic , social and regional impact , and which therefore affects the economic and social cohesion of Europe ?
if we continue down this path , and this is the ideology , and declare the financial markets to be sacrosanct and even claim that any intervention in the workings of these markets is contrary to progress and contrary to the growth of the economy , then we will quite certainly be on the wrong tack and that could take on quite dangerous proportions .
it is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member .
in those circumstances , consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result .
this necessary realistic and pragmatic policy , however , which will have to be associated with the elimination of the practical obstacles identified as unquestionable factors in this inequality must , as far as we are concerned , necessarily be based on the idea of complementarity , which is the only one capable of justifying a proactive policy on the subject .
this is because it is essential to achieve two things : the European model of multifunctionality in agriculture must be secured , and this must be done in a way which facilitates the liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products , mainly to the benefit of developing countries .
why should it be impracticable , and it can be differentiated , to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions , all the so-called cash transactions , currency futures and options ?
Mr President , from this year until the year 2006 around EUR 200 billion is available for the Structural Funds , but only 5 ¾ % is set aside for the Community initiatives , INTERREG , LEADER , URBAN and EQUAL .
we are familiar with Parliament &apos; s views and we know that Parliament is aware of the views of the Council &apos; s legal advisers .
it must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration .
it symbolises the need for solidarity with the countries of the south , particularly those in Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific which questioned us extensively on this subject in Seattle .
we respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our Member States as to the way ahead for Austria .
in any case , it should be clear that my group , of course , fully backs the recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men .
the other question is who should bear the cost .
however , it seems that none of the Member States meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors .
the Commission &apos; s current President , Mr Prodi , and the High Representative , Mr Solana , have put forward ideas along the same lines .
we have 1.27 % of the Community &apos; s GDP .
for it to enter into force , it must be ratified by all 15 Member States .
Madam President , I would also like to welcome the Commission &apos; s initiative of presenting us with a report on its strategic objectives for the next five years , although I hope that it intends , in subsequent documents , to avoid the excess of generalisations and the vagueness of the text which we are examining today .
if this is not to be a mere media event , it will need to be carefully prepared by a joint committee , the composition of which the Portuguese Presidency has already proposed .
I know of the proactive attitude of the European car manufacturing industry which has set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantling end-of-life vehicles .
I remember what Portugal and Greece used to be like when I drove through those countries for the first time twenty-five years ago .
therefore , I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area .
we run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways .
indeed , it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the Treaty .
we here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme .
then we shall follow the usual procedure , hearing one speaker in favour and one against .
therefore , the responsibility of the European Union has to be seen in a certain context .
do we have any figures ?
if the Council had worked as quickly as Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on .
let us make this clear , however much some people may not wish to believe it .
this lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs .
the regularisation of illegal immigrants in certain countries , including your own , must act as an example to others . these illegal immigrants nowadays constitute a plethora of vulnerable people at the mercy of slum landlords , an oppressed workforce subject to economic exploitation , rendering them modern-day slaves .
Parliament has not yet indicated why permission was withdrawn .
it will , I hope , be examined in a positive light .
I shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users , to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods .
such dialogue between the national parliaments , the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important .
I should like to make just a few comments .
the urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds .
Yes , but the point is to make a qualitative leap and , speaking in political terms , this , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , means convincing the other Community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment .
it certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities .
equally I understand the Commissioner failing to endorse such a tax , but I cannot understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue .
to this end , Europe as a whole , and each Member State individually , will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities , including the Structural Funds .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I am not sure which to go by : the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010 ?
you have taken 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year &apos; s work programme .
the common position puts European car manufacturers in a disadvantageous position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the European market .
there are , at the very least , rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again .
I would like to second what the previous speaker had to say .
it is , I think , regrettable that the Commission could not make a similar assessment of LEADER II , regarding the quality of the projects , the quantity of appropriations spent and , most especially , the demotivation of some local operators in the face of the administrative and financial unwieldiness they encountered .
the Finnish Presidency only listened to minimalist governments and , unfortunately , turned a deaf ear to this Parliament .
such a concern is misplaced .
what we have here is an ecological disaster .
the fact that the next round of Structural Funds 2000-2006 includes the INTERREG initiative is I believe , a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national EU Member States .
whether it is a matter of the balance of the biosphere , culture or cooperation with the third world , excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity .
in a religious school , it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs .
I should like to comment on the concerns which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has with regard to the largest of the four Community initiatives , INTERREG III .
Mr President , Commissioner , I second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims .
therefore , in future , prior approval should take place in a targeted manner , that is , only in cases of uncertainty or risk .
you talked about how women can help in increasing production and growth .
frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that European Union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process .
this is true , if we think of Russia &apos; s plans in the thirties , but at the start of your mandate , a few months ago , you yourself announced at the Conference of Presidents that you would , however , be presenting a legislative programme , or rather , the major policy lines of the European government of which you are head and in the running of which we are engaged today .
I also note that eligibility for expenditure shall be accepted from the date that programmes are presented and I can confirm the possibility that they may be available retroactively back to 1 January , if the programme is presented before 30 April .
many speakers have underlined this .
equal remains important to us because it is precisely in relatively more prosperous regions that lower-skilled jobs are being shed , which can be an important first destination for those discriminated against in the labour market .
neither will it stop raising vital issues . for example , how much progress are you willing to make and what measures , legislative or otherwise , will you be taking to combat the scourge of trafficking in human beings , child pornography on the Internet , drugs , and organised crime ?
but for pity &apos; s sake , and I am not saying this to you in an aggressive way , please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms .
note that this proposed tax , which seems to be producing strong emotions in some people , would be the lowest tax in the world and the lowest in the history of global taxation . yet it would represent the recapture of the areas seized from democracy by the financial sphere .
I would like to point out , however , that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us : maintaining a population in rural areas , given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture &apos; s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society .
we at the European Parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed Commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own House in order as well .
but it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation .
so , I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible .
I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach .
I should also draw your attention to the significance of the Barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation .
Belgians can deliver their cars back to the vendor without any cost .
in point of fact , I consider this to be necessary because we heard , following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market &apos; s visit to Luxembourg , that it is of course inevitable , a God-given fact as it were , that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service , and so more often than not , important cases handled by the Court of First Instance cannot be given the attention they deserve .
we sometimes regulate things which could , by and large , remain subsidiary .
when will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof ?
it is clear that the Council , for the moment , has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place .
a proposal can be made , a proposal should be made , on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty , by the middle of this year .
this is why I give this report my full support .
have the Council of Fisheries Ministers and the Commission assessed the impact of transferring the Portuguese quota for ICES zones XI and X and CECAF zone 34.1.1 to France ( 5000 metric tonnes per year overfishing ) on the ICES zone VIII anchovy stocks and their responsibility for the current situation of the anchovy stocks and the possible social and economic impact on this fisheries sector in the future ?
the attacks against Austria &apos; s new government and the attempts to exert political influence in a Member State are an insult to the Austrian people .
the statements we have heard today on the Middle East peace process are very opportune at the moment because of the hurried tour which Minister Gama - whose absence from this debate I also regret - has made of the region , accompanied by other Council representatives .
I would now like to move on to Lord Inglewood &apos; s remark .
we have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard .
there must , of course , be transparency regarding the selection criteria for projects and local action groups .
but what were the Commission &apos; s arguments , from Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and Director-General Eneko Landaburu in particular , for eliminating the URBAN programme ?
Mrs Avilés-Perea , that was an exhortation rather than a question .
is there anyone who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal ?
the Erika oil slick and the contamination of the Danube demonstrates the pressing need for European scale intervention to safeguard the environment .
moreover , they constitute environmentally hazardous substances of the worst kind .
we believe that justice should be done in this case , but this is not the most appropriate procedure .
I live in a region where the ship-building industry now has very serious problems : Asturias .
I am talking about the introduction of cultural mainstreaming in all policy areas , about consolidating and improving the European dimension of training and education syllabuses and about networking training and education policies in Europe especially lifelong learning .
in this regard , I liked your term , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi : we must all pull together , preferably in the same direction .
thank you , Commissioner , for your statement .
it has not yet been passed by the Council ; it is at the consultation stage .
I will keep myself free in this connection .
in response I shall say the same thing I said to Mrs McNally just now .
what criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States &apos; programmes ?
this system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms .
only after such critical appraisal of the future policies of the parties involved in the coalition discussions can a decision be made as to whether this government is contrary to the democratic spirit of Europe .
the resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mired in allegations of scandal .
the possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place , but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation , would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission , rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council .
we must also insist that the cost is borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer , as stipulated in the common position .
amendment No 19 is also unacceptable , given my thoughts on Amendment No 10 .
this means that we need a pressure instrument .
for we all know how long it takes a tree to grow .
what will happen to a place like Scotland , which I represent here ?
I remember Margot Wallström being introduced as Commissioner in the Committee .
my conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demands of the peoples of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union is already involved , namely enlargement .
OLAF , Europol and the Treaty on Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters should be used fully and , when the Fraud Convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the Member States , we can also achieve a lot with this .
I would merely say that the festive issue which Mr Dimitrakopoulos has raised is an extremely important one .
personally , I am pleased with some of the replies , for example , in relation to issues as sensitive as Schengen and the Europol Convention , which we hope will be reviewed , and I am pleased with the words of the Minister for Justice with regard to trying to bring them under the jurisdiction of the judicial authorities .
the discretional power of the State , which you propose in point e of your Amendment No 10 , seems to me to be inconsistent with the rest of your excellent report .
if we do not do this , we shall have failed in our duty .
to this end , I shall confine myself to stressing , out of all the choices available , the importance of three priority decisions which should , in the drawing-up of action programmes for the government of the Union , be the basis for both the Commission &apos; s agenda and the actions of the European Union in the coming months .
just a year ago when the Commission produced its proposals around Agenda 2000 it axed the URBAN initiative .
this Parliament has often heard the desire to reform the Commission expressed , even by its Presidents .
but , as for the future , since we must look ahead , I am extremely concerned to see how URBAN is going to be implemented in practical terms , and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn , because plainly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be , for future financial perspectives , a new European regional planning policy .
we must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice .
thank you , Mr Poettering .
it is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term .
the Commission is allocating 67 million pounds towards the INTERREG III programme , which will be spent on continuing the development of cross-border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
in the world of new technologies , the main danger remains that access to information will be easier the richer you are .
does the Commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five-point programme agreed between Parliament and the Commission in September , and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows Parliament to express an opinion on it ?
the Internet is not a product of the market , but the result of research financed by the American army .
the last question concerns the amount granted .
we are asking workers to be flexible , innovative and ever more productive , yet the fruits of this productivity increasingly benefit the shareholders alone .
all in all , INTERREG , the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process .
however , we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation ; it is just not possible .
this is why the mid-term review , provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260 / 99 , will be of considerable importance .
the aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995-1997 , including 40 % allocated to the manufacturing sector .
certain sectors of European industry , such as the shipbuilding industry , air transport and the steel industry , which have been hard hit by existing competition policy , have suffered tremendously .
Mr President of the Commission , you have represented and defended the European Parliament time and again over recent weeks .
any interference by the European institutions in this country is therefore unacceptable ; it is in violation of the European Treaty ( Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam ) .
most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest , which clearly there is not in this case .
ladies and gentlemen , on this point we must make it clear : in the context of subsidiarity , the selection of zones or municipalities eligible for URBAN is primarily the responsibility of the Member States .
however , there is also nothing more certain than EU environmental directives which have laudable intentions but which actually fail to achieve their stated objectives .
recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential .
consequently , I have tabled some amendments to Mr Koch &apos; s intrinsically excellent report , which have been adopted by our committee .
Mr President , the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so .
it is just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the European Parliament or its committees any documentation .
the second concern which I notice that many of you share - it was first expressed by Mr Bourlanges , but others have repeated it - refers to the situation regarding the other donors .
most of the technical issues have been resolved .
instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as Lloyds of London , we must develop new technologies to retrieve from the sea much more than 10 % of the lost oil .
we are setting the Commission a massive task , not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard .
this is what we wish to do : maintain our role as a supranational structure , maintain the role conferred on us by the Treaties , but also be unwavering on principles and make judgements based on facts .
this , Commissioner , is the first commandment for the coming period .
the second report of the Wise Men arrived in September .
these old vehicles are testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognised and respected by Europe , if we are not to water down each of our specific identities .
this is , of course , because it is a waste of resources for us not to ensure that materials in cars are recycled .
finally , in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the citizens of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship .
the Tampere Council , the motor and architect of this objective , has proposed certain goals , but five years , the time scale laid down for the implementation of Chapter IV of the Treaty , is too long to wait for the urgent solution which some problems require .
finally , as the committee representing energy , we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more , thus , through a process of coordination , increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums .
we are in the process of building a house but too few of our citizens really feel at home in our house .
we all know that , in 1995 , it was agreed that the Union &apos; s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law .
if you look carefully , this proposed tax on capital is just one of several instruments aimed at forcing international investors to behave responsibly on the financial markets .
in this way vehicles of historic value can be preserved for future generations .
because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible .
to give a non-contentious example , no commercial exhibitions can be held here in Parliament for obvious reasons .
my group will not be supporting those amendments .
I believe that is a good thing
so , really , these bodies should already provide for a balance , and take into account the wishes of the union movement and environmental movement in the process .
so , for example , the island of Réunion is located on a trade axis between the countries of southern Africa and those of south-east Asia .
50 is exactly the level of development of my own region , the Azores , one of the regions defined in the Treaties as ultra-peripheral .
this is part of risk management .
we experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms , no sanitation , no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.coli-infected water .
in my capacity as Commissioner for the Internal Market , I am , in other words , opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions .
thirdly , I do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population , owing to the ageing of the population , is unavoidable and inevitable for the European Union . this is not just because of the existence of margins which would permit an increase in the number of working women and immigration , but because we need to be determined in reversing the widespread trend of early retirements from the job market , and direct the coordinated reform of social welfare systems , certainly not towards large reductions in future pension payments but towards the active use of people &apos; s increased life expectancy and towards a longer working life .
this is why it is so hard to strike a balance , not only between the different countries or the different components , but especially between the different groups listed in the programme , and in fact this is what has preoccupied us to date .
the correct speculative approach , it seems to me , is to remove the real causes which lead to financial chaos , rather than attempting to suppress its symptoms by introducing obstacles to the operation of the markets .
I believe that Turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation treaty , but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in Europe and I think it is quite right to discuss them here in Parliament .
I think it is the right of a Member of Parliament to raise his own concerns and fears .
in Germany , there would probably be dancing in the streets if we were to say that we were holding a referendum on payments to the European Union and we shall pay if the German people are prepared to pay .
since then , the victims &apos; families , who have not had the consolation of justice , since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges , have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least .
there is no doubt that I myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at European level .
in this respect we wish you every success . however , we are also aware of our role as the Commission &apos; s watchdog .
what we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid , so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date .
the &quot; Erika &quot; incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected , but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe .
those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax-recycling centres , the tax havens , of which there are 62 in all .
like the rapporteur , while I am pleased with the Commission report , nonetheless I deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid .
eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the European Union , despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world : these are the results of this competition which the European institutions intend to promote .
it is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector .
consequently , for end-of-life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-of-life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs .
aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator , which will water down all the aims of competition policy .
this is the new element that we must help to bring to the Balkans .
this calls into question the agreement which Parliament reached , with great difficulty , with the Council in December , according to which , when the Commission presents a multiannual programme for reconstruction , the financial perspectives would be reviewed where necessary .
if we allow Europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement , we will drown in our own political quagmire .
as for the other points , Mr Prodi , I will take economic and social policy as an example : the European social model is certainly experiencing a major crisis and it is certainly not coincidental that unemployment tops the list of problems that none of our policies has managed to resolve , but it is not certain that it can be resolved by going through a list of problems that we have discussed in the past , without having a clear idea or proposal which takes note of the fact that Europe contains economies that are growing at some of the most sustainable rates and that it is not by chance that these are the economies which have made labour market flexibility and enterprise their prime objective .
I am pleased to see , however , that under LEADER + , new resources have been allocated to helping rural territories to develop their potential and to implement the objectives of local and sustainable development .
so we are working within this framework and not outside it .
trade union representatives sit on the Disciplinary Board and the Staff Regulations Committee , thereby making it impossible to remove disloyal officials and preserving the Staff Regulations in their fossilised state .
more or less each of the 50 states in the US has two elected positions in the United States Senate , regardless of its population .
amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references .
you will cynically and hypocritically use Austria as a convenient threat to further strip the Member States of any real powers in the construction of the European Union .
the concept of transparency stands out in the report .
the initiative adopts a completely new approach , which is to develop innovative employment models within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnerships .
in addition , I would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production , for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions .
the first is asylum .
confronted with this threat , which carries with it the negation of the very idea which lies at the heart of the construction of Europe , nothing must deter us : not the legal quibbling about what the treaty does or does not permit , not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene , not the derisory respect for formal democracy , and , above all , not the feeling of powerlessness which grips us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our convictions but which we are powerless to control .
I think your intervention may clarify various points that were raised .
it is not true to say that , when a government forms an alliance with neo-Fascists somewhere in Europe , this is merely a question of national sovereignty .
this combination of instruments enables us to implement a policy of rural development which today , furthermore , is one of the ways in which the common agricultural policy - in one of its dimensions - and regional policy also , have developed and changed .
if car manufacturers all set up their own dismantling companies , this will necessitate transporting end-of-life vehicles over long distances .
it can only succeed if agreements are made which are solidly based on compliance with democratic principles .
the deadline by which it had to answer the Commission &apos; s questions expired on 6 December 1999 and we have not received a reply .
my third and last point concerns the role of the European Union .
Mr Verheugen has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
Mr President , I am in the happy position of being able to refer to a couple of striking contributions from a small group of Nordic sceptics and opponents of the drastic and growing integration process which , looked long and hard at , threatens the whole of democratic Europe .
the next item is the Commission statement on the oil slick off the French coast .
full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens .
reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the Theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are .
a technical improvement in the flexibility system will not be enough : we also have to raise the issue of developing our institutions for the countries in the vanguard as proposed by Jacques Delors , for example .
the functionalist approach has brought us to this point .
I would like to thank Mr President-in-Office of the Council .
it is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to Parliament &apos; s plenary sitting today that Europe &apos; s 25 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions .
this event must underpin enlargement .
indeed , the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence , and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well ?
if those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive , this would be very detrimental , not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament &apos; s credibility on environmental issues .
the PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda .
indeed , both parties will need to make huge efforts .
it should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are , however , still pending before the Council .
we recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working .
I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments , including a re-instatement of the Commission &apos; s original budget .
the guiding thread running through all the aspects of the reform of competition policy , which we shall have the opportunity to address together , aims to ensure more effective protection of competition , reduce the bureaucratic burden weighing down businesses and take decision-making processes closer to the European people .
I envisage that the board &apos;s membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders .
I should now , Mr President , like to bring up the subject of INTERREG and to thank the rapporteur , Francis Decourrière , in the same way that I thanked Arlene McCarthy , for the quality and relevance of his work .
will Israel let Palestinian refugees return or be given compensation ?
we therefore need to be strict in the enlargement process and respect those agreements which - should it be necessary - need to be redrafted with regard to certain fundamental issues such as the environmental disaster that has occurred in Romania , reaching as far as Belgrade , but above all , the continuing spread of apathy as regards major security issues .
with particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are created , I would like to say , first , that there is , via the Social Fund , an entire equal opportunities pillar which the Member States must implement , i.e. special policies for women which must use Social Fund resources .
I was also encouraged by Commissioner Patten &apos; s comments this morning about a rapid reaction fund for security crises .
the important thing is that we are consistent , and I have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since I accepted the position of Commissioner .
codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand .
moreover , due to the immense economic and social interests involved , we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event , as is now quite normal .
INTERREG must , therefore , be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a two- or even three-speed European territory .
what do we ask of this structure - the European Community - which is , so to speak , ambiguous and unique ?
Portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor &apos; s book .
an important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions .
leader II ( 1994-1999 ) , for which a total evaluation has , unfortunately , not yet been completed , had a wider scope than LEADER I : there were probably over 800 beneficiaries and the sums allocated , after reallocation of resources , probably amounted to over EUR 4 000 million .
this has already been made clear a number times in this debate .
Commissioner , it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform .
Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel , let me say how disappointed I am , because I personally thought this problem had been resolved long ago .
the Commission is , in fact , retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities , but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the Commission at all .
lastly then , Europol , which started its work in 1999 . the Council approved a set of instruments , with which Parliament is familiar , to make Europol &apos; s operations viable but , of course , the fundamental issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol still remain , and these are issues which have naturally taken on a new dimension in view of the political decision taken in Tampere to reinforce Europol &apos; s powers and , above all , to give it an operational dimension .
that goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new , better quality of life .
ecological tax reform is what my group would like to stress the importance of , because we can only create employment and sustainable development by changing our taxation structure . but , unfortunately , as we all know , this is an area where the European Union is totally unable to act .
there have been some votes where we have not followed the guidelines of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party , and we have voted in favour of the Terrón i Cusí resolution , which we consider on the whole to be excellent .
in reality , however , the Commission communication does not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects .
we noticed this when we had to investigate the Flechard affair , which , as it happens , has still not been sorted out .
I would like to say that the work carried out during this time by Parliament has been of a high quality , and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Langen and also all the various speakers who have spoken both in committee and here in plenary .
should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions !
there is , in fact , a risk of a military coup in the future .
I am optimistic and quite relaxed and confident about the vote ; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on EQUAL .
by stimulating a diversity of investments , the European Union is endeavouring to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment .
the new coalition agreement is about reforming a democracy , the rights of the opposition , commitment to compensating those forced into hard labour ....
however , I am sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which is both an economic and a social factor , which affects not only Germany but all the coastal regions of Europe .
as far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned , we shall abstain from voting , and where , finally , the motion for a resolution is concerned , we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it .
I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti .
one of the objections is that , due to the restricted role of the elected bodies , businesses gain more influence .
I should like to stress that the EQUAL initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed European strategy .
three serious issues were discussed : the first was the first discussion on the fifth programme for women , of which I gave an initial evaluation , the second issue was the report by Mr Busquin on the investigation into the participation of women in research and science , and the third involved Mr Kinnock , who reported to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the gender equality dimension in the overall reforms currently taking place in the Community .
in fact , I believe that things have been done by the Commission , but there is still more to do .
I am convinced that this is an error of judgement .
third point : interregional cooperation , the importance of strand C. The Commission shares the observations made by this House regarding the importance of strand C , interregional cooperation .
it is now February and we are still waiting .
in fact , this directive , like so many others addressing environmental issues , is not good .
it appears that there is agreement and support with regard to the prioritisation of South-East Europe , with regard to enlargement and - as I have said already - with regard to the process of integration and the strengthening of the Euro-Mediterranean programme and our ability to prevent conflicts , as well as an issue which we seldom talk about ; the North-South challenge .
why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long-term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short-term and speculative investments unattractive .
I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the United States , but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and , therefore , the liability of shipowners , and also to hold liable those who charter ships , which is to say the owners of the cargo .
Mr President , firstly my thanks and appreciation to Commissioner Patten for his comments here today , particularly in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace process , and for reaffirming that our role is not only that of &quot; banker &quot; for the entire operation .
at a hospice for AIDS patients , I met two Irish Catholic nuns who were caring for dying AIDS patients .
this is an irreparable loss .
furthermore , the tripartite relationship of Commission , Council and Parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy , where hitherto the Council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case , especially in relation to the crudely fashioned crisis management measures , for which the Commission alone has responsibility .
TV pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife , in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks , have brought back memories of similar British disasters , such as the Torrey Canyon in 1967 , and have prompted many British volunteers to help .
the Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies &apos; ban to be unsatisfactory , something I would wholeheartedly agree with .
today we must give the green light to this conference , and , for its part , the Group of the European People &apos; s Party , Mr President , is ready to give that green light .
however , the Council should also bear in mind that , if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime , we do not only need to widen Europol &apos; s remit , as decided at Tampere ; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its remit to operational activities .
thank you for a very clear answer , the gist of which - if the interpretation is correct - is that the posting of workers directive entails an obligation on the part of the Danish state to establish a system of universally applicable agreements .
I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly , but this is a serious problem .
it is good that this directive should be established now , as , otherwise , Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time , a period of transition , which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy .
we can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from Parliament .
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks , but the question is , how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes ?
we believe the vast number of recommendations of the Wise Men &apos; s report should be implemented .
as we have heard , the objective of URBAN is the promotion of innovative strategies to promote economic and social regeneration in urban areas , bearing in mind that 80 % of the population of Europe lives in cities .
we are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised .
it is , moreover , also accepted as an important and effective tool .
Mr President , I am pleased to see the convergence of viewpoints there is between Parliament , particularly the Committee on Budgets , and the Commission , and we can assure you that , for our part , we shall always be there to assist the Commission in the performance of its duties .
unfortunately , we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future .
we have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type .
in my opinion , we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic structure should be placed : small and medium-sized businesses , which bind the European economy together , and social protection , which Europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy .
frankly , I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory .
I therefore think it is crucial for the environment that the ban on using poisonous heavy metals should be fully implemented and that we should not reduce manufacturers &apos; liability .
the only arguments against it are : firstly , it would impair the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little fanciful in light of the financial feeding frenzies we have seen that have destroyed jobs throughout the world , in East Asia , Europe and Latin America .
I have great expectations for the Portuguese Presidency .
( FR ) This report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy .
in the important debate on competition this morning , I expressed my views on Mr Langen &apos; s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth Steel Aid Code .
however , Israel is not the only country concerned with security .
it is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects delivered on time but without local participation .
however , as politicians we must ask the question why 27 % of the Austrian population voted for a party such as the FPÖ at the elections in October 1999 .
we nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for enlargement to take place .
truly European citizenship depends on our creating a real , visible area of training and culture .
it has been communicated explicitly and repeatedly to Kosovar leaders that international support will depend to a large extent on the way non-Albanian minorities are treated .
I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently .
we are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible .
the Food Safety Authority &apos;s situation is quite different .
can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse .
he stressed a number of points , with which we may indicate our agreement , as many of you did too - the importance of this trans-European cooperation , with its three strands , cross-border , transnational , interregional ; the added value to the Community provided by INTERREG , its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds , and the truly cross-border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations ; the importance of common structures and what , in discussing another debate which begins today , the Intergovernmental Conference , I termed the common European spirit which we have to strengthen , and here , with INTERREG , thanks to INTERREG , is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity ; the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners .
Madam President , Representative of the Council , Commissioner , a week ago , the big international Holocaust Conference ended in Stockholm .
Mr President , for British Conservatives the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the European Union .
more generally , those signatories who take part in or have taken part in government in the various States of the European Union must take their share of responsibility in the influence which the extreme right has managed to gain since their policy , devoted exclusively to the interests of big business , has not included taking action likely to eradicate unemployment and the poverty it engenders , and has thus facilitated the xenophobic demagoguery of the extreme right .
Brussels is not all of us , as you claim . it is all of you .
question No 28 by ( H-0781 / 99 ) :
the financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made , not in every case , but wherever uncertainties or risks arise .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , during the Asian crisis in 1997 , as with those which hit Mexico in 1995 or the EMS in 1993 , everyone could see the damage caused to the economies of entire countries by financial speculation , particularly currency speculation .
after all , innovation in areas that have already grown prosperous is paying dividends even now and taking place without European funding .
firstly , however , I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Langen , for the truly excellent work he has done on this report .
for all these reasons I voted in favour of the Langen report , and I now await the Commission &apos; s response to our requests and demands .
the practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be downgraded .
I would also like to express my concern - which is very considerable - at the statement by some Ministers at the last Ecofin that says that it should be a priority of the Portuguese Presidency not to alter , in any circumstances , the financial perspectives agreed in Berlin .
nevertheless , these same institutions showed no reluctance to accept Turkey as a candidate for membership of the European Union , despite its well-known human rights violations .
clearly , many citizens are &apos; disenchanted and anxious &apos; about the lack of real and lasting solutions to basic problems , such as unemployment and social exclusion , which affect our very existence . this must be one of our absolute priorities .
one reason for the acceptance of this proposal , and of the campaigns by NGOs such as ATTAC , SOLIDAR or others which have popularised this proposal , is that it would release resources which could be allocated to development programmes in the poorest countries , in areas such as education or health .
I want to know whether this also applies in the document which the Commission has presented now .
nonetheless , if the opportunity for Member States to determine the areas , within the scope of this initiative , remains available , then the Commission will have to ensure a certain focusing of resources and prioritise projects in the less prosperous areas .
however , I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage .
the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the Union is doubtless a good idea , but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a European legal system .
on the other hand , we can be fairly confident for the future because we know the efforts that car manufacturers are prepared to make in order to find ( a ) materials that are easier to recycle and ( b ) to set up recycling industries .
Yes , e-Europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs .
the Arab world &apos; s criticism of Israel has been founded upon the same sort of anti-colonialism as , for example , Algeria &apos; s fight for freedom against France .
we therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hulten &apos; s report .
we now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle , and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it , something which is clearly established in the present communication .
history has taught us that Fascists start to blow hot and cold : using heated words first , in populist , xenophobic speeches , and then cool words in order to make themselves acceptable to institutions and to infiltrate them gradually , poisoning them , until the day they start to take action .
recently , I have noticed that the Commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner , precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility , both for products and for services .
let me point out , in passing , that the Commission President , Mr Prodi , is also a Council member , and he has every intention of making use of this position and this role , alongside the Heads of State and Government , particularly during the final period .
the relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive , 95 / 35 / EC , seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods .
Mr President , tomorrow will see a large majority within the PPE Group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , as well as the amended version .
Madam President , it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure .
from what I have said , it must be obvious to you that the European Parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of observer .
subject : measures to advance gender equality One of the working groups of Commissioners announced by President Prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to advance gender equality ( gender mainstreaming ) .
allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe , which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods .
my only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver .
my only regret is that my own commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East , even though , as I mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events conspired to maroon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki .
you wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders . consequently , you have opened Europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration .
the Council therefore reiterates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen .
the fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lies with the occupying country , Israel , does not prevent the Arab partners from also having a considerable share of the responsibility .
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety , but I would ask you to endorse this report .
we therefore demand that once the Treaty expires , steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94 , for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity .
what is more , the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this .
over the coming years , faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement , Europe will , more than ever before , require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy .
even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion , its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union &apos; s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC .
instead , we should go for good-quality projects that can act as a catalyst to effect change and renewal , to attract inward investment in terms of loans and venture capital and to achieve a multiplier effect .
being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities .
the means of achieving this are difficult but they are real .
and a fully-fledged Europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully rediscover its roots , highlight its common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic islands that until now were less well-known .
we now have a framework programme , the first of its type for the cultural sector , and this programme makes it possible for us to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive , but also more thorough and detailed manner .
the next item is the report ( A5-0022 / 2000 ) by Mr Brok , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo ( COM ( 99 ) 0598 - C5-0045 / 00 - 1999 / 0240 ( CNS ) ) .
indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved .
it says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability .
just you go home and say : &quot; we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date &quot; .
the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds , perhaps mainly guillemots , may have died .
we could not agree more with the latter .
question No 8 by ( H-0796 / 99 ) :
the main objective of this debate is to look at the instruments available to the international community for stabilising the international financial and monetary system .
if it functions well , if we are satisfied , if the Commission has basically acted correctly , why the need for the modification ?
a ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly .
throughout the negotiations , they were of great help and it must be said that the difficult and occasionally tiresome negotiations were nonetheless completed in record time .
it would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in EU legislation .
we will support the motion for a resolution in support of this study , but we simply insist that , as this motion for a resolution points out , it is by means of liberalisation and opening up at an international level that we will achieve economic progress , both on the level of states and on a general level .
by stressing , primarily , the quality of the information provided , our debate in committee , and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you , avoided a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid was , in absolute terms , either too high or not high enough .
what we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the Union &apos; s policies to date .
that should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue , but not in this report .
you have excellent Commissioners for both issues in Mrs Palacio and Mr Barnier , yet still you attach too little importance to these areas .
unfortunately , developments are not moving in that direction .
this is all the more serious , if that is possible - as others have said - bearing in mind that your Commission , Mr Prodi , has to carry out nothing less than a revision or reform of the current common fisheries policy , which you are legally required to do in 2002 .
not because our delegation , our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gargani did not work exceptionally well - they worked very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong objection to Commissioner Reding &apos; s attitude - I think that , given the framework she was operating in , her attitude was particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the Council .
having said this , I still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation .
provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments , it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points .
but this is not in place .
one of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control .
the Commission can commit itself to regularly informing Parliament of the invitations to tender which are published .
in order to prevent this threat to the system , it is ready to do anything , including overruling the outcome of free elections , including setting up a thought police , including establishing a new form of totalitarianism .
it is important that after the first step , which has already been taken , i.e. forming OLAF from UCLAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF , in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework .
I urge the Council and the Council Presidency to continue to protect the fundamental values of the Union .
human labour , on the other hand , is considered to be a simple factor in the equation .
of course there is also the Charter of Fundamental Rights , and work began on its wording yesterday , which I believe has started very positively .
1997 was a matter for the old Commission and , therefore , the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability .
urban funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the UK , in Moss Side .
on the other hand , we have to see to it that none of the achievements or aims of integration that have been stated thus far are watered down .
we have endeavoured to provide material help .
we could , in no way , agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package .
peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels .
the promotion of scientific development and new technologies and access for all to these technologies will not be provided by the market or competition . the latter will also not ensure the social proximity and effectiveness of the main community services of health , education , transport , communications , water and whatever else .
hence our amendment in order to prevent contradictions between general policy and actual projects .
however , it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office .
similarly , the idea that the euro has fostered a consensus on wage moderation is not really borne out by the repeated nervous orders issued by the European Central Bank to the trade unions which are deemed to be too demanding .
there are twin problems that still remain for many regions in Europe : firstly , the lack of adequate infrastructure in terms of road , water treatment facilities and related transport networks ; secondly , the need to put in place initiatives to combat youth and long-term unemployment , which is a constant social problem in many urban and rural parts of Europe .
we have calculated that the cost of recycling cars does not constitute more than one per cent of the price of a new car .
President .
the European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency .
however , we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months .
we agree that they ought to be indicative in nature , allowing the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programmes .
naturally , sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information , but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible .
the White Paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examined : the exchange of confidential information .
competition is not an end in itself , as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out , but it plays an extremely important role in European integration .
underground networks ?
Mr President , I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general .
we debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the Commission , even where it is merely submitting a paper .
the entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term .
we can take action against this ; it is possible .
the first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a Member State which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide services there .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Member , Robert Goebbels , who is unable to attend due to a political commitment .
as you can see , half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session .
the McCarthy report on the URBAN Community Initiative gives us an opportunity to reflect on the appropriateness of Community intervention in urban matters .
when six European countries have granted the right to vote , the President of this House can venture to extend this right to vote , and eligibility to participate in the municipal and European elections , to all people from outside the Community who have lived in Europe for more than five years .
by this I mean that there are aspects of the form and procedure of the Community institutions &apos; workings which are not accessible to the other institutions , and not only as regards the Commission &apos; s relationship with Parliament , but also as regards the Commission &apos; s relationship with the Council .
this across-the-board approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way .
in all such cases , however , strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the European Commission gained .
in order to do so , the monitoring committees must be opened to include Members of the European Parliament , associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society .
a document is circulating at the moment - not at a low level , but at a high level within the Commission - which , instead of enhancing the public nature of documents , is having the opposite effect .
Madam President , my Group is extremely delighted that this debate is taking place today , particularly as we have spared no effort along with Members of other groups to bring this about .
this is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are , when all is said and done , on the global scale merely a peninsula .
the amendment of the Treaties was , however , limited to a review of some internal rules , which was necessary and important , but did not answer the fundamental question : what is Europe , what are its common principles and therefore , its objectives and limitations ?
Mr President , I would like to take a brief , critical look at the accession negotiations with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to , and admiration for , the many NGOs that have at least rolled up their sleeves in order to save animals .
reference was made earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be given to the millions of people who work in the car industry in various countries and to those countries which have large car industries , for example my own country , Sweden .
I would remind you that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive ; the costs are not excessive : recycling a car costs less than 1 % of the price of a new car .
their efficiency has been truly remarkable .
Court of First Instance
the work is done . all that remains is the business of enforcement .
that is our duty .
but the question is now : is the European Union doing anything about it as well ?
perhaps this is also why , as is rumoured to be the case , the Council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well .
we need technical testing of ships , that is obligatory technical testing every two years , and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate .
after all , examining the issue of transparency in the ways the institutions operate should never be hidden away under any old heading or confined to some lobby or other - though I know full well the importance of these lobbies .
